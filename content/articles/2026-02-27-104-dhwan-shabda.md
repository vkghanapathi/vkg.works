abstract: This analytical article examines the physiological mechanisms of human speech
  production, detailing the three-part process of respiration, phonation, and articulation.
  The work extends its scope to comparative sound production across vertebrate and
  invertebrate species, providing a systematic overview of acoustic mechanisms in
  the natural world and concluding with an examination of sound reception and perception
  across different organisms.
preamble: While this work does not derive from classical Indian scriptural traditions,
  it represents a modern analytical approach to understanding speech (vāk) and sound
  production—topics central to Sanskrit linguistic philosophy and Vedic studies. The
  systematic examination of vocal mechanisms relates historically to Sanskrit phonological
  theory and the articulatory descriptions found in classical Sanskrit grammatical
  texts, which documented place and manner of articulation with remarkable precision
  centuries before modern speech science.
