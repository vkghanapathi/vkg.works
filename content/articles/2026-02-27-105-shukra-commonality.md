title: 1. The Physics of "Burning" (Dahana)
date: '2026-02-27'
author: Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī
status: draft
abstract: 'This article presents a phenomenological comparison of motion and control
  across two domains: the retrograde motion of Venus (Śukra) in Jyotiṣa (Vedic astrology)
  and the motility of semen (śukra) in human reproduction. Rather than positing causal
  mechanisms, the work identifies structural analogies in how motion is modulated,
  constrained, and made fertile within regulatory spaces, arguing that this mode of
  inquiry—pattern recognition across scales without causal reduction—represents a
  classical Indic epistemological method grounded in Ṛta (cosmic order).'
preamble: This work draws on the Jyotiṣa tradition, the classical Indian science of
  astronomy and astrology preserved in Sanskrit texts and incorporated into Vedic
  knowledge systems. The inquiry situates itself within an Indic phenomenological
  framework that examines patterns of motion, desire, and constraint as they appear
  both in celestial phenomena (tracked by planetary observation) and in embodied human
  experience (particularly generative biology). The author explicitly positions this
  as a reading of Jyotiṣa not as physics or mechanism, but as a philosophy of experience
  and pattern, consistent with how Vedic thinkers understood the interconnection between
  macrocosmic (loka) and microcosmic (deha) orders through principles of correspondence
  rather than causation.
