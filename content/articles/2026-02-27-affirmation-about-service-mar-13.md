title: Jaya Guru Datta
date: '2026-02-27'
author: Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī
status: draft
category: administrative
abstract: A formal letter of affirmation addressed to the Chairman and Executive Trustee
  of Avadhoota Datta Peetham, in which Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapathi responds to allegations
  contained in a forged letter circulated to affiliated trusts. The document serves
  as both a personal rebuttal and an institutional communication, affirming the author's
  continued service and integrity while addressing the collateral harm caused to his
  family and colleagues by the defamatory campaign.
preamble: This work emerges from the administrative and institutional context of Avadhoota
  Datta Peetham, a spiritual organization within the Datta tradition that traces its
  lineage to the Avadhuta philosophy of non-dual realization. The letter reflects
  the internal governance practices and dispute-resolution mechanisms of a contemporary
  Hindu monastic institution, while invoking the authority and blessings of the Guru
  (Sri Swamiji) as the ultimate arbiter of truth and conduct within the ashrama community.
