title: Appeal to HRD Minister Pallam Raju
date: '2026-02-27'
author: Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī
status: draft
category: administrative
abstract: A policy advocacy document addressed to India's HRD Minister urging substantial
  increases in government funding for MSRVVP (Maharshi Sandeepani Rashtriya Veda Pratishthan),
  the autonomous nodal body responsible for Vedic education in India. The appeal documents
  systemic underfunding affecting Vedic teachers, students, and gurukula institutions,
  and proposes concrete reforms including enhanced student stipends, revised enrollment
  minimums, and administrative oversight by Vedic scholars to ensure the preservation
  of living Vedic traditions.
preamble: This work addresses the institutional infrastructure supporting Vedic education
  and Sanskrit studies within India's modern state system. The Vedic tradition—encompassing
  the Rigveda, Yajurveda, Samaveda, and Atharvaveda—has been transmitted through oral
  and residential pedagogical systems (gurukulas and pathashalas) for millennia. The
  appeal situates contemporary challenges to Vedic transmission within a larger concern
  for the survival of India's 'living heritage,' invoking both the ritual and cultural
  significance of Vedic scholarship and the socioeconomic vulnerability of communities
  dependent on traditional Vedic education.
