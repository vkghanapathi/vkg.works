title: Appeal to Prime Minister, Ministries of HRD & Culture
date: '2026-02-27'
author: Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī

abstract: A formal petition addressed to the Prime Minister and Ministry of Human
  Resource Development requesting increased institutional support and curricular expansion
  for Vedic education in India. The appeal advocates for the establishment of advanced
  degree programmes in Vedic studies, Sanskrit philology, and classical commentarial
  traditions, coupled with enhanced stipends for scholars and systematic funding for
  traditional guru-kula institutions.
preamble: This work engages with the institutional framework of Vedic scholarship
  in contemporary India, specifically addressing the Maharshi Sandeepani Rashtriya
  Veda Pratishthan (MSRVVP), the nodal autonomous body under the Ministry of Human
  Resource Development tasked with the preservation and promotion of Vedic education.
  The petition situates itself within the broader concern for the continuity of the
  guru-śiṣya paramparā (teacher-student lineage), a foundational pedagogical model
  of Sanskrit and Vedic learning that has sustained Indian classical traditions for
  millennia. By invoking exemplars of multi-disciplinary Vedic scholarship such as
  Kālidāsa, Śrīharṣa, and Vidyāraṇya, the appeal appeals to a vision of comprehensive
  scholarly cultivation rooted in traditional Hindu intellectual life.
