title: Proposal to Conduct
date: '2026-02-27'
author: Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī
status: draft
category: administrative
abstract: This proposal outlines a symposium on Atharva Veda semantics and a national
  convention of Atharva Veda teachers. The document provides a comprehensive preamble
  establishing the scriptural status, historical transmission, and contemporary custodianship
  of the Atharva Veda, with particular attention to the two surviving recensions (Śaunaka
  and Paippalaada śākhās) and the endangered lineages of practitioners, especially
  in Odisha and Jharkhand.
preamble: The Atharva Veda is the fourth Veda of the Hindu scriptural canon, traditionally
  associated with the sages Bhṛgu and Aṅgiras as primary transmitters and Śaunaka
  and Pippalāda as subsequent systematizers. Unlike the Rig, Yajur, and Sama Vedas
  which are organized by ritual function, the Atharva Veda comprises mantras devoted
  to practical domains including household welfare, medicine, protective rituals,
  and natural philosophy. This text situates the proposal within the broader context
  of Vedic preservation and pedagogy, documenting the institutional and genealogical
  history of extant Atharva Vedic schools and their precarious contemporary status
  in India.
