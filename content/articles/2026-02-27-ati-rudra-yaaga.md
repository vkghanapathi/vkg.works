abstract: An announcement and technical exposition of the Ati Rudra Yaaga conducted
  at Avadhoota Datta Peetham in November 2010 under the direction of Jagadguru Parama
  Pujya Sri Ganapati Sachchidananda Swamiji. The article provides ritual specifications,
  theological significance of the Rudra Adhyaya mantras from the Yajurveda, categorical
  classifications of Rudra Homa practices, and the traditional benefits attributed
  to participation in this elaborate eleven-day Vedic ceremonial.
preamble: The Ati Rudra Yaaga represents the most elaborate form of Rudra worship
  within the Yajurvedic ritual tradition. Grounded in the Shatarudreeya section of
  the Yajurveda—comprising 169 mantras addressed to Rudra (Shiva) as the omnipresent
  and omnipotent divine force—this ceremony follows the Vedic methodologies codified
  in the Bodhayana and Apastamba Sutras. The ritual involves the synchronized recitation
  and oblation sequences performed by 121 qualified priests (ritwiks) over eleven
  days, organised in a scalar progression from Eka Rudram (single priest, single recitation)
  through Maha Rudram and culminating in the Ati Rudram, representing the highest
  order of this yaaga.
