status: draft
category: analytical
abstract: This analytical essay examines contemporary unemployment in India through
  the lens of Bhagavad Gita teachings on occupational duty (kula vṛtti) and the dignity
  of labour. Dr. Ghanapathi applies economic theory—specifically demand and supply
  equilibrium—to explain widespread joblessness among graduates of prestigious institutions,
  arguing that societal devaluation of manual and traditional trades has created critical
  sectoral shortages in agriculture, construction, manufacturing, and allied fields.
preamble: This work draws from the Bhagavad Gita, Hinduism's foundational philosophical
  text embedded within the Mahabharata, which prescribes occupational roles according
  to dharma (righteous duty) and varna (social function). The author references the
  Rudra Adhyaya of the Yajurveda, which catalogues and honours artisanal professions,
  to recover an ancient Indian epistemology that sanctified all forms of skilled labour.
  The essay situates contemporary economic dysfunction within a Vedic-classical framework
  that historically integrated vocational diversity with social cohesion.
