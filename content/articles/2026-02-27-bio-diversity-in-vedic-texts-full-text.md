abstract: This technical article examines references to fauna, flora, and biodiversity
  embedded in Vedic texts, particularly the Yajurveda Saṃhitā, arguing that these
  references preserve ecological and taxonomic knowledge alongside ritualistic utility.
  The author contends that Vedic mentions of animal species, birds, and plants—often
  associated with deities or ritual recipients—reflect sophisticated environmental
  observation and an implicit doctrine of ecological preservation that has been overlooked
  in modern scholarship. The work bridges ancient scriptural knowledge with contemporary
  biodiversity studies, proposing that Vedic classifications offer insights into species
  distribution, ritual significance, and ecological awareness in antiquity.
preamble: In the Vedic tradition, animals, plants, and birds hold symbolic and cosmological
  significance, being associated with divine forms and celestial deities as recipients
  of ritual sacrifice and worship. The Yajurveda, one of the four Vedas, contains
  extensive references to fauna within its descriptions of ritual practice (kratu
  and iṣṭi), classified according to their recipients—whether directed to ancestors
  (paitruka) or deities (daivika). This work examines how these scriptural references,
  traditionally interpreted through a ritualistic lens, encode systematic knowledge
  of biodiversity and ecological relationships that reflect the intellectual heritage
  and observational capabilities of Vedic-age civilizations.
