abstract: An instructional article announcing a ritual performance of Durgā Saptaśatī
  recitation (Chandi Path), Kāli worship, and fire sacrifice (havan) scheduled at
  the Datta Nāth Temple in Delhi's Sarup Nagar, presided over by Dr. Vamshi Krishna
  Ghanapāṭhī and other Vedic scholars. The article provides technical guidance on
  the structure, benefits, and proper methodology for performing Durgā Saptaśatī readings,
  including the three narrative cycles (charitra) corresponding to the three guṇas
  and their respective tantric applications.
preamble: This work situates itself within the Hindu Śākta ritual tradition, specifically
  the worship of the Divine Mother (Devī) through recitation of the Durgā Saptaśatī
  (also known as Chandi Path), a 700-verse Sanskrit composition from the Mārkandey
  Purāṇa. The Durgā Saptaśatī forms a cornerstone of Śākta liturgy and is traditionally
  performed during the month of Māgh (January–February) in temples dedicated to forms
  of the Great Goddess. The article combines liturgical announcement with doctrinal
  exposition, explaining how the three charitra sections correspond to divine manifestations
  and tantric efficacies, thereby serving both as a devotional guide and a practical
  manual for ritual performers.
