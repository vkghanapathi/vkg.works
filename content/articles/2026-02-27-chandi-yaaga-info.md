abstract: A systematic exposition of Vedic and post-Vedic sacrificial rituals (yagna/yaaga),
  examining their etymological foundations, classificatory schemes, and liturgical
  purposes. The work presents a comprehensive typology of yajnas organized by ritual
  format, textual authority, soteriological intent, and temporal frequency, with particular
  attention to the democratization of ritual practice through Puranic prescriptions
  such as Chandi Homa.
preamble: This work situates itself within the Hindu ritual tradition as transmitted
  through Vedic, Smarta, and Puranic sources. It addresses the theory and practice
  of yagna—the central devotional and propitiatory rite in Hindu orthopraxy—drawing
  on the Veda (Shruti), the Grihya and Shrauta Sutras of Aswalayana, Smriti texts,
  and the eighteen Puranas compiled by Vyasa. The author contextualizes both elite
  Vedic sacrifice (requiring extensive Brahminical training) and accessible devotional
  rituals (such as those dedicated to Ganesha and Chandi) within a unified taxonomic
  framework, making classical ritual knowledge available to contemporary practitioners.
