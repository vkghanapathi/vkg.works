abstract: An administrative essay on cow protection (go-seva) grounded in Vedic scripture,
  articulating the theological and practical rationale for bovine veneration within
  the Hindu tradition. The work synthesizes textual authority from the Rigveda, Yajurveda,
  and Bhagavata Purana with contemporary ethical advocacy, proposing three modes of
  engagement—dietary abstinence, devotional reverence, and agricultural support—as
  expressions of Vedic duty toward cattle.
preamble: This work situates itself within the Vedic tradition of go-seva (cow service),
  a foundational practice in Hindu dharma rooted in the scriptural identification
  of the cow (gauh) as mother and embodiment of divine sustenance. Drawing on the
  Rigveda and Yajurveda—the oldest Vedic texts—as well as the Bhagavata Purana's emphasis
  on Krishna's pastoral relationship with cattle, the author frames bovine protection
  as a sacred obligation prescribed in ancient scripture and urgently relevant to
  contemporary practice in the context of Kali Yuga (the present age of spiritual
  decline).
