abstract: A technical note on Chaturmāasya Iṣṭi, a Vedic ritual performed seasonally
  to propitiate deities and ensure communal welfare. The work explains the cosmological
  significance of seasonal cycles, the ritual's theological purpose, and provides
  a detailed schedule of performances conducted at SGS Ashrama, Mysore in May 2010,
  identifying the appointed Vedic scholars (Ritviks) who performed the rite.
preamble: Chaturmāasya Iṣṭi belongs to the tradition of Śrauta Yāga—elaborate Vedic
  fire rituals prescribed in the Vedas and elaborated in ancillary scriptural texts
  (Śrauta Sūtras). This seasonal ritual, conducted in three four-month cycles annually,
  embodies the Vedic understanding of time (Kāla) as a cosmological principle governing
  creation and social order. The rite propitiate Viśvadevas, Indra, Varuṇa, Agni,
  and other seasonal deities, alongside ancestral and divine forces, maintaining cosmic
  and social equilibrium through properly performed oblations (Āhuties) and mantric
  utterance.
