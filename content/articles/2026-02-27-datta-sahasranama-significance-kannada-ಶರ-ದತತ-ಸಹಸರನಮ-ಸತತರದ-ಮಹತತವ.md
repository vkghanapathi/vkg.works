abstract: This analytical article examines the spiritual significance and efficacy
  of continuous recitation of the Śrī Datta Sahasranāma Stotra, a thousand-name devotional
  hymn honoring Dattātreya. Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī establishes the textual
  origins of this stotra within the Nātha-Datta sampradāya, traces its liturgical
  role in Datta sacred sites, and systematically presents the fruits of regular japa
  according to traditional phalaśruti (results enumerated in scriptural texts).
preamble: Within the Datta tradition—a significant branch of Hindu devotional practice
  centered on Dattātreya, the three-form avatāra of Brahmā, Viṣṇu, and Rudra—the Śrī
  Datta Sahasranāma Stotra holds canonical status. This stotra is recited daily in
  major Datta pilgrimage sites such as Gāṇagāpur and Māhūr, and is traditionally chanted
  with particular intensity on Datta Jayantī (the full moon of Mārgaśīrṣa). The work
  traces the liturgical and philosophical context of this devotional practice, drawing
  on manuscript sources and established sampradāya conventions to illuminate the transformative
  effects of continuous mantra recitation within contemporary spiritual life.
