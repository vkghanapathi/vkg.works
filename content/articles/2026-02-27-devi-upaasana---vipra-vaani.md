abstract: An analytical examination of Devi Upasana (the worship of the Divine Feminine)
  as the foundational principle underlying both cosmic manifestation and inner spiritual
  realization. The work presents Shakti—the dynamic, primordial energy—as the activating
  force of the absolute, responsible for creation, sustenance, and dissolution, and
  argues that the fierce forms of the Goddess, particularly Kali, represent a direct
  path to self-realization through the destruction of ego and illusion.
preamble: This article situates itself within the Shakta philosophical and devotional
  tradition of Hinduism, which centers the worship of Devi (the Goddess) as the ultimate
  reality. Drawing on the Tantric and Puranic understanding of Shakti as the inseparable
  dynamic principle complementing Shiva's transcendent consciousness, the work synthesizes
  classical theological frameworks—particularly the triadic functions embodied in
  Saraswati, Lakshmi, and Kali—to articulate how Devi Upasana serves as both a cosmological
  principle and a soteriological practice. This tradition has been central to Hindu
  spiritual life for millennia and is elaborated extensively in the Devi Mahatmya,
  Shiva Sutras, and various Tantric texts.
