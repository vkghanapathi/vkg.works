abstract: This technical article outlines the principal ritual practices conducted
  at Avadhoota Datta Peetham under the direction of Sri Ganapati Sachchidananda Swamiji.
  The work categorizes these practices into six segments—Puja, Homa, Vratam, Daanam,
  Aalayam, and Yaatra—and provides detailed documentation of temple worship protocols,
  daily observances, and ceremonial customs specific to the Datta tradition, with
  particular emphasis on practices such as Abhishekam, Datta Bhiksha, and Kakada Arati.
preamble: This work situates itself within the Datta Sampradaya (tradition of worship
  devoted to Dattatreya), a significant strand of Hindu devotional practice centred
  on the trinity deity Dattatreya. The Datta Peetham functions as an institutional
  continuation of Vedic ritualism and contemporary devotional service, operating under
  the custodianship of an established spiritual lineage. The practices described draw
  upon Vedic protocols and Puranic narratives concerning Dattatreya's sixteen principal
  incarnations, integrating classical ritual frameworks (Homa, Vratam, Daanam) with
  institutional innovations in temple worship and pilgrimage networks across multiple
  consecrated shrines.
