abstract: An analytical examination of Dhanurmāsa (the month of Dhanus), a sacred
  month in the Hindu liturgical calendar celebrated particularly among Viṣṇu devotees.
  The article traces the scriptural foundations of this observance through the Dhanurmāsa
  Māhātmya of the Pañcarātra Āgama, surveys the ritual practices and theological significance
  associated with the month, and explores the devotional practice of reciting Tiruppāvai—a
  Tamil devotional poem attributed to Āṇḍāl—as the primary spiritual practice during
  this period.
preamble: This work situates itself within the Pañcarātra theological tradition and
  Tamil Śrīvaiṣṇava devotional practice. Dhanurmāsa (also known as Mārgaśīrṣa in lunar
  reckoning) occupies a prominent place in the liturgical calendar of Viṣṇu worship,
  marking a period when specific rituals, dietary practices, and devotional disciplines
  are prescribed. The article draws upon classical Sanskrit sources including the
  Bhagavad Gītā (10.35), Pañcarātra scriptural dialogue, and Tamil devotional literature,
  particularly the works of Āṇḍāl and Viṣṇuchitta, bridging Sanskrit Vedic authority
  with vernacular Tamil religious expression.
