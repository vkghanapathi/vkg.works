author: Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī
status: draft
category: technical
abstract: A philosophical and theological exposition on the Digambara form of the
  deity Datta at the Gandigunta shrine in Andhra Pradesh, authored by Dr. Vamshi Krishna
  Ghanapāṭhī. The work etymologically and metaphysically interprets 'Digambara' (sky-clad)
  as a principle of boundlessness and all-pervasiveness, correlating the concepts
  of *ākāśa* (space) and *dik* (direction) to establish Datta as the supreme, non-limiting
  principle of consciousness. The text commemorates the silver jubilee celebrations
  and the *Brahmakalasha-abhiṣeka* (consecration with Brahma's water-pot) of the Datta
  Digambara temple, founded in 1991 by the Datta Pīṭhādhipati.
preamble: This work belongs to the theological literature of the Datta Avatāra tradition,
  a significant sect within Śaivism and Hindu Vedāntic philosophy centred on Dattātreya
  and his manifestations. The Datta Pīṭha (monastic seat) at Mysore represents a living
  lineage preserving guru-śiṣya paramparā (teacher-disciple transmission). The exposition
  draws upon classical Vedāntic epistemology and the Vāstu Śāstra framework of cosmological
  directions and principles to articulate the metaphysical significance of temple
  worship and guru-principle (*guru-tatva*) within this tradition.
