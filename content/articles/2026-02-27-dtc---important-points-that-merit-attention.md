title: Important Points for the Consideration of Finance Minister for inclusion

category: administrative
abstract: A policy advocacy document addressing proposed amendments to India's Direct
  Taxes Code (DTC) concerning the taxation and regulatory status of religious trusts
  and charitable endowments. The work identifies three substantive areas of concern—mandatory
  state endowment registration, restrictions on inter-trust fund transfers, and corpus
  fund accumulation rules—and proposes modifications to ensure equitable treatment
  of religious institutions across all faith communities under constitutional principles
  of equal protection.
preamble: This work emerges from contemporary Indian administrative and fiscal discourse
  on the legal status of religious trusts (dharma sabha) and charitable organizations
  within the Indian constitutional framework. It addresses tensions between central
  income tax administration (IT Department) and state-level endowment regulation,
  with particular attention to how statutory provisions affect Hindu religious institutions,
  particularly temple trusts and feeding charities (anna daana), in comparison to
  Islamic waqf structures and other faith-based charitable entities. The document
  engages with post-independence Indian law governing tax exemption, religious autonomy,
  and secular state administration.
