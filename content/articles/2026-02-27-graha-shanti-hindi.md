title: ग्रह शांति क्या है?
date: '2026-02-27'
author: Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī
status: draft
category: analytical
abstract: This analytical article examines the semantic origins and classical understanding
  of *grahashānti* (planetary propitiation) within Vedic and jyotiṣa traditions. The
  work etymologically analyzes the term *graha* (meaning 'to hold' or 'to grasp')
  and distinguishes between celestial bodies, explores the nine-planet system (*navagraha*),
  clarifies the nature of *Rāhu* and *Ketu* as shadow planets, and explains the concept
  of *grahadṛṣṭi* (planetary aspect) as understood by ancient *ṛṣis*. The author demonstrates
  how planetary conjunction and individual planetary influence affect terrestrial
  events, contextualizing propitiation practices within classical astronomical and
  astrological frameworks.
preamble: This work situates itself within the classical Indian jyotiṣa (Vedic astrology)
  tradition, drawing upon both Vedic cosmology and the specialized knowledge preserved
  in jyotiṣa texts. The concept of *grahashānti* derives from ritual and philosophical
  systems documented in post-Vedic jyotiṣa literature, which systematized the relationship
  between celestial mechanics and human affairs. The article bridges ancient *ṛṣi*
  astronomy with contemporary understanding, acknowledging both traditional Sanskrit
  sources and modern scientific frameworks while maintaining fidelity to classical
  hermeneutic principles.
