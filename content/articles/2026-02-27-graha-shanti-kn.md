title: ಗ್ರಹ ಶಾಂತಿ ಎಂದರೇನು?
date: '2026-02-27'
author: Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī
status: draft
category: analytical
abstract: A foundational analytical article examining the etymology, astronomical
  classification, and astrological significance of the nine grahas (planets) in Hindu
  cosmology. Ghanapāṭhī explicates the distinction between self-luminous stars (nakshatras)
  and planets (grahas), the role of the sun as graha-adhipati, and the concept of
  graha-shanti as the mitigation of planetary influences on terrestrial events. The
  work bridges Vedic astronomical knowledge with classical jyotisha doctrine, clarifying
  how ancient rishis systematized the perceived relationships between celestial bodies
  and human experience.
preamble: This article situates itself within the Vedic and classical Hindu astronomical
  tradition (jyotisha shastra), drawing upon both Vedic texts and later astrological
  compendiums. The nine grahas occupy a central place in Hindu cosmological thought
  and ritual practice, serving as the primary objects of observation and propitiation
  in Vedic astrology. The concept of graha-shanti—propitiatory rituals to mitigate
  the adverse effects of planetary positions—remains foundational to Hindu ritual
  life and depends on the theoretical framework established by ancient rishis. Ghanapāṭhī's
  analysis clarifies the philosophical underpinning of this practice by demonstrating
  how the ancient designation 'graha' (from grah, 'to grasp' or 'hold') reflects a
  metaphysical understanding of planetary influence over human affairs.
