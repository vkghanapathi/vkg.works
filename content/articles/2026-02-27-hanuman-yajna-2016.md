abstract: An administrative article documenting Sri Ganapathy Sachchidananda Swamiji's
  global campaign to recite the Hanuman Chalisa—a 40-stanza devotional hymn composed
  by Tulsidas—as a spiritual remedy for contemporary worldly afflictions. The work
  outlines the campaign's progression from its January 2015 launch to a planned series
  of eleven Hanuman Yajnas (ritual sacrifices) at geographically and mythologically
  significant sites across India and the diaspora.
preamble: This article operates within the Bhakti devotional tradition and the classical
  Hindu practice of yajna (sacrificial worship). The Hanuman Chalisa, though composed
  in medieval Hindi by the saint-poet Tulsidas rather than in Sanskrit, occupies a
  central place in contemporary Hindu devotional practice, particularly among worshippers
  of Hanuman—the monkey deity revered as the embodiment of courage, devotion, and
  loyal service to Rama in the Ramayana epic. The article frames collective recitation
  and ritual performance as remedial spiritual interventions aligned with classical
  scriptural prescriptions for addressing social and cosmic disruption.
