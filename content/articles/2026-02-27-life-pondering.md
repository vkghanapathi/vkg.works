title: What is Life (expectancy)? ...... 1
date: '2026-02-27'
author: Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī
status: draft
category: technical
abstract: 'A philosophical inquiry structured as a series of introspective questions
  designed to guide readers through a systematic examination of life''s fundamental
  dimensions: origin, purpose, relationships, conduct, and legacy. The work addresses
  life expectancy not merely as a statistical measure but as an existential framework
  for ethical self-assessment, particularly at the threshold of midlife (forty years),
  proposing that this juncture presents an opportunity for deliberate realignment
  of priorities and meaningful action.'
preamble: This work participates in the long Indic tradition of ātma-vicāra (self-inquiry)
  and jīvana-darśana (life-philosophy), drawing implicitly from Hindu ethical frameworks
  concerned with dharma (righteous duty), karmaphala (consequences of action), and
  the proper ordering of life stages (āśramas). Rather than prescriptive doctrine,
  the text employs the Socratic method of questioning—a mode found throughout Upaniṣadic
  dialogue and classical Sanskrit philosophical texts—to activate the reader's own
  reasoning capacity regarding mortality, responsibility, social obligation, and spiritual
  progress within a single lifetime.
