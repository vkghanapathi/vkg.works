category: analytical
abstract: This analytical article presents a comprehensive lexicographic and scriptural
  examination of the Sanskrit term माता (mātā, 'mother'), tracing its etymological
  roots, semantic scope, and ritual-religious significance across Vedic and Purāṇic
  literature. The work systematically catalogs maternal figures—both biological and
  metaphorical—recognized in Hindu sacred tradition, including five principal objects
  of veneration, sixteen categories of mothers, and goddess forms acknowledged in
  Vaiṣṇava worship, with extensive textual citations from the Kaurma Purāṇa, Padma
  Purāṇa, and Brahma Vaivarta Purāṇa.
preamble: This work operates within the Sanskrit philological and Dharmaśāstra tradition,
  where etymological analysis (nirukti) and scriptural exegesis serve to establish
  the theological and ethical foundations of Hindu kinship values. The article draws
  upon Pāṇinian grammatical principles, Uṇādi sūtra morphology, and the normative
  authority of Purāṇic literature to articulate the status of motherhood as a supreme
  object of devotion (pūjā) across multiple schools of Hindu thought, particularly
  Vaiṣṇavism. Within this framework, the mother occupies a unique position as simultaneously
  biological nurturer, spiritual guide, and divine principle worthy of reverence exceeding
  even that owed to other gurus.
