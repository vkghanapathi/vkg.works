abstract: An article by Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī documenting the continuation
  of Vedic ritual lineage (yājñika paramparā) through the Maddūri family, particularly
  following the establishment of the Yajñadatta Kṣetra (temple) in Jujjūru village
  under the guidance of Śrī Gaṇapati Saccidānanda Svāmī of the Dattapīṭha. The work
  records the performance of the Agniṣṭoma (Soma) yāga by Yajñanārāyaṇa Śāstri and
  contextualizes this ritual continuity within both household fire worship (agnihotra)
  and guru-disciple transmission.
preamble: This article belongs to the Vedic sacrificial tradition (yājña paramparā)
  documented in the Yajurveda and Agnihotra Brāhmaṇa, tracing the maintenance of Vedic
  ritual obligations and their spiritual significance within contemporary Hindu practice.
  It situates the performance of major Soma sacrifices within the framework of both
  daily fire worship and the relationship between a ritual family and their spiritual
  preceptor (guru), illustrating how classical Vedic knowledge and practice are preserved
  and transmitted across generations through institutional structures such as temple-based
  ritual centers.
