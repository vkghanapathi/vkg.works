abstract: A technical exposition on vivāha (marriage) as a foundational life transition
  in Vedic dharma, structured as a dialogue examining the contractual, spiritual,
  and constitutional dimensions of matrimonial union. The work synthesizes Vedic ritual
  protocols, ethical virtues (ātma-guṇas), and the sixteen saṃskāras (life-cycle rites)
  to establish marriage's role across the four temporal categories of human existence
  and its necessity for progression toward spiritual birth.
preamble: This work situates marriage within the Vedic framework of life transitions
  and ritual practice. Drawing on the Dharmaśāstra tradition and the Vedic saṃskāra
  system, it examines vivāha as both a contractual agreement and a transformative
  ceremony essential to dharma (righteous duty). The exposition integrates references
  to subsidiary Vedic rituals—Brahma Yajña, Vaiśvadeva, Pitṛ Tarpana, and the Soma
  ceremonies—alongside the cultivation of eight cardinal virtues (kindness, forbearance,
  freedom from envy, purity, equanimity, auspiciousness, generosity, and desirelessness),
  positioning marriage as a means of spiritual and social stabilization in Hindu philosophical
  and ritual life.
