abstract: 'An administrative programme document outlining a series of Vedic rituals
  and scholarly events organized at Ananda Ghanam in Mysore across September and October
  2018. The document details three major events: a Śata Chandi Yāga (hundred-recitation
  Chandi ritual) with Bhāgavata Parāyana, a Sāhasra Chandi Yajña (thousand-recitation
  ritual) spanning from Bhādrapada Pūrṇimā through Vijayadaśamī, and a symposium on
  scientific approaches to Vedic traditions with emphasis on agriculture and animal
  husbandry.'
preamble: This work documents the ritual and pedagogical activities of Dr. Vamshi
  Krishna Ghanapaṭhī, a scholar and administrator specializing in Vedic studies. The
  programmes centre on the recitation and ritualistic performance of the Devī Māhātmya
  (Chandi Saptaśatī), a foundational text within Hindu ritual and devotional traditions,
  integrated with Vedic yajña methodology and Bhāgavata recitation. The events align
  with the lunar calendar and festival observances of the Indian tradition, including
  Navaratrī observances dedicated to the nine forms of the Divine Mother.
