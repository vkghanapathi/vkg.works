abstract: This administrative article presents a contemporary American nonprofit organization's
  initiative to promote cow protection and service (go-seva) grounded in Vedic philosophy.
  The work synthesizes scriptural references from the Rigveda, Yajurveda, and Bhagavata
  Purana with practical guidance on nutritional, agricultural, and ethical dimensions
  of bovine stewardship, framing cow protection as a spiritual and communal duty in
  the modern context.
preamble: This article draws upon the classical Hindu understanding of the cow (go)
  as sacred and maternal, a concept deeply embedded in Vedic literature and consolidated
  in Puranic theology, particularly in Krishna-centric devotional traditions. The
  Vedas prescribe three cardinal duties toward cattle—service, worship, and protection—which
  form the ethical and ritual foundation for this contemporary initiative. The work
  situates itself within the broader framework of Vedic dietary philosophy, agricultural
  sustainability, and the cyclical relationship between human beings and livestock
  as described in ancient Indian scriptural tradition.
