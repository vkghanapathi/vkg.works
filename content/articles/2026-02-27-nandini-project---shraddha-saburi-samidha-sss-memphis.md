title: New Project - Nandini Go Seva - Bhu Seva
date: '2026-02-27'
author: Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī
status: draft
category: analytical
abstract: This analytical article presents the theological and practical foundations
  for Go Seva (cow service) as a contemporary spiritual project, grounding the practice
  in Vedic and Puranic textual authority. The work articulates the threefold Vedic
  duties toward cattle (seva, puja, and rakshya) and establishes the cow's role as
  essential provider and mother figure within Hindu cosmology and material sustenance.
preamble: This work situates cow veneration within the broader Vedic tradition, drawing
  explicitly on passages from the Rigveda and Yajurveda, and on the devotional theology
  of the Bhagavata Purana, particularly the Krishna-centric cow-herding narratives
  of Vrindavana. The text synthesizes Vedic injunctions with Puranic narrative to
  construct a contemporary framework for Go Seva as both spiritual discipline (sadhana)
  and ecological stewardship, reflecting a long Hindu philosophical tradition that
  sacralizes bovine care as fundamental to civilized (Aryan) conduct and cosmic balance.
