abstract: A pedagogical dialogue in Telugu examining the nature and purpose of nityakarma
  (daily obligatory duties) within Hindu dharmaśāstra tradition. The work clarifies
  the distinction between casual daily activity and prescribed ritual observance,
  explaining how nityakarma functions to mitigate karmic consequences and maintain
  spiritual discipline across lifetimes.
preamble: This analytical essay belongs to the modern explicatory tradition of Vedic
  and Dharmaśāstra instruction in vernacular Telugu. It addresses the foundational
  concept of nityakarma—daily duties prescribed in the Vedas and Smṛti texts—which
  form part of the Pañcamahāyajña (five great sacrifices) framework. The dialogue
  format reflects the guru-śiṣya (teacher-student) pedagogical method central to Hindu
  learning traditions, here applied to clarify how ritual observance relates to karma
  theory, spiritual welfare, and the maintenance of household and monastic life.
