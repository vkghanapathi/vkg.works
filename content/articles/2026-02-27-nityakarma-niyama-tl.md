abstract: This analytical article examines the doctrine of nityakarma (daily obligatory
  duties) as prescribed in Śrauta and Smarta traditions, exploring their philosophical
  justification, soteriological purpose, and ethical significance. The author clarifies
  that while nityakarma yields no direct fruit (phala), it serves the dual purpose
  of expunging accumulated karma (upatta-durita-kshaya) and purifying the mind (chitta-shuddhi),
  thereby establishing the foundation for dharmic conduct and social order.
preamble: This work is situated within the Vedic ritual and dharmaśāstra traditions
  of Hindu orthopraxy, specifically addressing the prescriptions found in Śruti (Vedic
  revelation) and Smṛti (remembered tradition) regarding obligatory daily observances.
  The analysis draws upon classical exegetical frameworks that reconcile the apparent
  paradox of performing actions without expectation of reward—a central tension in
  Karma Yoga philosophy and the ethics of duty-bound living (kartavya-nishtha) outlined
  in texts such as the Dharmasūtras and Purāṇas.
