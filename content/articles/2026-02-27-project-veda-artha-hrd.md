abstract: This introductory article establishes the foundational significance of Vedic
  literature and its allied texts within Indian intellectual and spiritual traditions.
  The work outlines the multifaceted dimensions of Vedic knowledge—from phonetic recitation
  and ritualistic efficacy to philosophical depth and contributions to mathematics
  and science—while arguing for comprehensive preservation that extends beyond superficial
  practice to encompass authentic textual transmission and interpretive methodology.
preamble: Situated within the Sanātana Dharma tradition, this work addresses the contemporary
  challenge of maintaining Vedic heritage in its original form across generations.
  It acknowledges the historical role of Āchāryas in establishing rigorous transmission
  protocols while critiquing modern preservation efforts as predominantly confined
  to ritual observance rather than deep engagement with the scriptural foundations.
  The work thus positions itself as a call for holistic restoration of Vedic knowledge
  through dual emphasis on textual integrity (śabdātmaka) and proper interpretive
  frameworks.
