abstract: A foundational essay establishing the scope, significance, and methodologies
  for Vedic preservation and interpretation. The work argues that authentic transmission
  of Vedic knowledge requires dual commitment to textual fidelity (Śabdātmaka Veda
  Parirakṣaṇa) and methodologically sound exegesis, moving beyond superficial liturgical
  practices toward restoration of philosophical and linguistic roots.
preamble: 'This essay situates itself within the broader Sanātana Dharma tradition
  and the institutional concerns of Vedic scholarship and recitation practice (Ghanapāṭha).
  It responds to contemporary gaps in Vedic preservation, acknowledging historical
  efforts of Vedic ācāryās to maintain textual integrity through oral transmission
  while identifying modern challenges: the shift from purely oral pedagogy to written
  documentation, and the predominance of ritual observance over philosophical grounding.
  The work addresses both traditional practitioners (pundits, purohits) and contemporary
  patrons seeking authentic engagement with Vedic literature.'
