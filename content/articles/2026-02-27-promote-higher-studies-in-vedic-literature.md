abstract: A comprehensive institutional framework for the dual preservation of Vedic
  knowledge through textual integrity and interpretive methodology. Dr. Vamshi Krishna
  proposes systematic projects addressing pronunciation standardization, visual representation
  of Vedic script, pedagogical reform, and the establishment of interpretive guidelines
  grounded in traditional śāstra to ensure authentic transmission of Vedic philosophy
  and ritual practice across generations.
preamble: This work belongs to the contemporary Vedic preservation movement within
  Sanātana Dharma, addressing the institutional crisis of Vedic learning in modern
  India and diaspora communities. Drawing on traditional āchāra (ritual practice)
  and the methodological frameworks of Vedāṅga studies, the author situates preservation
  efforts within both the word-based (śabdātmaka) and meaning-based (arthātmaka) dimensions
  of textual transmission—a distinction rooted in classical Vedic hermeneutics. The
  work responds to the observation that contemporary religious institutions prioritize
  superficial ritual performance over foundational scriptural literacy and philosophical
  understanding.
