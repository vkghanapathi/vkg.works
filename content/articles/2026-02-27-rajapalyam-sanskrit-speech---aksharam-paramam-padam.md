status: draft
category: technical
abstract: This technical article examines the metaphysical and ritual significance
  of the syllable ॐ (Om) and the concept of *akṣaraṁ paramaṁ padaṁ* (the supreme imperishable
  word) as the ultimate ground of being. Drawing extensively from Vedic hymns and
  Upaniṣadic passages, the work systematizes the doctrinal framework of syllabic worship
  (*akṣaropāsana*), the metrical foundations of Vedic ritual, and the cosmological
  principles governing sacrificial efficacy and spiritual attainment.
preamble: This work is situated within the Vedic exegetical tradition, particularly
  the Upaniṣadic metaphysics of sound and the ritualistic theology of the Yajurvedic
  corpus. It engages with the classical understanding of *om* as the primordial syllable
  encompassing all creation, a doctrine central to both Vedānta philosophy and ritual
  orthopraxy. The article traces the doctrine from the *Ṛgveda*, *Yajurveda*, and
  *Sāmaveda*, explaining how syllabic analysis (*varna-jñāna*), metrical composition
  (*chandas*), and ritual utterance (*mantra*) function as coordinated means of accessing
  the imperishable absolute (*brahman*). The treatment integrates references to the
  *Gāyatrī* mantra, the *vyāhṛtis*, and the sacrificial system (*yajña*) as unified
  expressions of this supreme principle.
