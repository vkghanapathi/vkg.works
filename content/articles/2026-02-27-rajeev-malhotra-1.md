abstract: A research framework addressing core questions about deity origins and theological
  evolution across the Vedic corpus, Upanishadic philosophy, and epic literature.
  This work examines the genealogy of major deities (particularly Ganesha), the theological
  shift from feminine cosmology in the Rigveda to masculine-centered frameworks in
  later texts, and the reconciliation of competing creation narratives within Vedic
  thought.
preamble: 'This inquiry situates itself within the broader study of Hindu theological
  development across textual strata—from the earliest Rigvedic hymns through the Upanishads
  and the Itihasa (epics). It addresses a fundamental interpretive problem: the apparent
  theological reorientation from goddess-centered cosmologies (exemplified by Aditi
  as primordial mother) in Vedic literature to masculine-dominant paradigms in later
  philosophical and narrative traditions. The work also traces how individual deities
  accumulated cosmological significance (as forces governing creation, maintenance,
  and dissolution) and how these doctrinal developments culminated in the evolution
  of temple-centric worship practices in historical Hinduism.'
