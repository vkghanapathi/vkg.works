title: शतश्लोकि रामायणम्
date: '2026-02-27'
author: Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī
status: draft
category: analytical
abstract: Śatashlokī Rāmāyaṇam is a condensed Sanskrit learning series presenting
  the first chapter (Saṅkṣepa) of Vālmīki's Rāmāyaṇa in 100 verses, designed for contemporary
  Sanskrit students. The work combines traditional Devanāgarī text with transliteration,
  word-by-word meanings, and bilingual study questions, situating classical Sanskrit
  philology within the pedagogical framework of Vedic-Purāṇic literature.
preamble: This work belongs to the Sanskrit language pedagogy tradition that treats
  Vālmīki's Rāmāyaṇa—the foundational epic of Hindu dharma literature—as both a spiritual
  and linguistic resource. The Rāmāyaṇa itself is revered in Indian intellectual culture
  as the earliest and most authoritative work in classical Sanskrit composition, and
  this condensed adaptation follows the historical practice of creating sampuṭa (epitomised)
  versions for memorisation and study. Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī's presentation
  aligns with guru-paramparā (scriptural transmission) methods, framed within the
  Avadhūta Datta Pīṭha tradition and endorsed by Śrī Gaṇapati Sachchidānanda Swāmī,
  embedding linguistic education within devotional and dharmic contexts.
