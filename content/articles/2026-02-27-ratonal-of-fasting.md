title: Rational of the fasting
date: '2026-02-27'
author: Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī
status: draft
category: technical
abstract: This technical article by Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapathi examines the philosophical
  and physiological rationale underlying vrata (ritual fasting) practices in Hindu
  tradition, particularly Ekadashi fasting. Through the lens of Vedic jurisprudence,
  the author decodes apparent metaphorical language in the Puranas regarding the consumption
  of sin through grain foods, establishing a systematic framework of six fasting levels
  that progress from complete abstinence to modified dietary substitution, thereby
  reconciling scriptural commandments with contemporary understanding of bodily regulation
  and mental discipline.
preamble: This work situates itself within the living ritual tradition of Hinduism,
  specifically addressing the widespread observance of Ekadashi vrata (fortnightly
  fasting days dedicated to Vishnu) documented in the Puranas and upheld across Indian
  philosophical schools. Dr. Ghanapathi engages the Vedic epistemological tradition
  to provide a rational exegesis of what might otherwise appear arbitrary or superstitious,
  grounding ritual practice in principles of bodily detoxification, psychological
  conditioning, and spiritual attentiveness. The work references the Vedic conceptual
  vocabulary of sin (represented through metaphorical association with grain consumption)
  and includes Sanskrit citations from ritual texts illustrating how appetite (kshut)
  functions as an obstacle to devotion.
