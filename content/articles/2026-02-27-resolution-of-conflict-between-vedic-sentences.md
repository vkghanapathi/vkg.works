title: Resolution of the seeming Contradictions
date: '2026-02-27'
author: Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī
status: draft
category: technical
abstract: This technical article examines apparent contradictions in Vedic creation
  narratives by presenting passages from the four Vedas and their associated Upaniṣads
  and Brāhmaṇas that describe the origin and manifestation of the universe in seemingly
  different orders and mechanisms. The work demonstrates that Vedic cosmology encompasses
  multiple valid frameworks of creation—involving Prajāpati, Puruṣa, Rudra, Nārāyaṇa,
  and the principle of non-being (asat)—each illuminating different ontological perspectives
  rather than constituting logical inconsistencies.
preamble: This article is situated within the Vedic exegetical tradition of resolving
  apparent inconsistencies across Śruti (revealed scripture). It draws on the four
  Vedas—particularly the Yajurveda through the Taittireeya Saṁhitā, Taittireeya Brāhmaṇa,
  and Taittireeya Upaniṣad—as well as the Ṛigveda, Sāmaveda, and Atharvaveda, alongside
  classical Upaniṣadic texts including the Chāndogya and Aitareya Upaniṣads. The methodology
  reflects the systematic harmonisation approach characteristic of Vedānta philosophy,
  where multiple scriptural statements are reconciled through careful textual analysis
  rather than rejection of authoritative sources.
