abstract: A formal evaluation report assessing the Comprehensive Database of Veda
  Scholars and Ahitagnis of Andhra Pradesh, compiled by Vidwan Samavedam Surya Narayana
  Murty at SV Vedic University. Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī examines the necessity,
  scope, and merit of this scholarly registry as a contemporary quality-assurance
  mechanism for Vedic education, situating traditional certification practices within
  modern institutional frameworks while emphasizing the preservation of Vedic scholarly
  standards and the transmission of knowledge to successive generations.
preamble: This work addresses the institutional documentation and validation of Vedic
  scholarship within the living tradition of Vedic studies in Andhra Pradesh. The
  evaluation engages with the ancient Indian educational framework of guru-śiṣya paramparā
  (teacher-student lineage) and its modern institutional expressions through universities
  dedicated to Vedic learning. By invoking classical Sanskrit verses on the nature
  of scholarship and heritage transmission, the author contextualizes contemporary
  database-creation as both a quality-control mechanism consistent with Vedic pedagogical
  tradition and a means of preserving the lineage of scholars engaged in Vedic recitation
  (ghanapāṭha), Vedāṅga studies, and ritual practice (Ahitagni).
