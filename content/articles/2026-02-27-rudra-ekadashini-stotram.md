abstract: A technical examination of the term Rudra and its multivalent meanings within
  Vedic theology and ritual practice. The article traces the etymology and philosophical
  significance of Rudra across its manifestations as both individual soul (jīvātmā)
  and supreme reality (paramātmā), then contextualises the Rudra Adhyāya within the
  Yajurveda's ritualistic framework, explaining its structure, efficacy, and integration
  with complementary Vāsordharā practices in worship cycles.
preamble: This work addresses the Rudra Adhyāya (also known as Śatarudríya), a central
  liturgical chapter of the Yajurveda comprising 169 mantras dedicated to Lord Śiva
  in his fierce and auspicious aspects. Within the Vedic ritual tradition, the Rudra
  Adhyāya occupies preeminent status as a source of both philosophical doctrine concerning
  the omnipresence of the divine and practical technology for ritual performance (homa).
  The article situates its analysis within the broader Yajurvedic emphasis on ritualistic
  precision and the theological framework that understands phenomenal forces—earth,
  energy, wind—as emanations of Śiva's supreme consciousness.
