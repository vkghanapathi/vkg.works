abstract: 'This article examines the spiritual and philosophical significance of birth
  anniversaries (Sadguru Janma Dina) within Hindu tradition, presenting them as occasions
  for structured self-assessment rather than secular celebration. Drawing on Vedic
  timekeeping systems and Dharma Shastra principles, Ghanapāṭhī articulates seven
  essential objectives for observing birth anniversaries: gratitude for human embodiment,
  annual review of moral progress, spiritual planning, wealth distribution, longevity
  prayer, guidance from spiritual teachers, and life reorientation toward ultimate
  goals.'
preamble: This work is situated within Hindu spiritual and Dharmic traditions that
  integrate astronomical calculation (Jyotiṣa), horoscopy (Jaataka Chakram/Kundali),
  and ethical conduct (Dharma Shastra) as interconnected systems for human development.
  The author positions the birth anniversary observance as a classical Hindu practice
  rooted in the Vedic understanding of temporal cycles (Brahmaanda and Pindaanda)
  and the relationship between celestial phenomena and human life. By grounding birth
  day observance in ancient methodologies of time-reckoning and spiritual introspection,
  Ghanapāṭhī reclaims this occasion from modern secular celebration as a formal instrument
  of dharmic self-examination and spiritual alignment.
