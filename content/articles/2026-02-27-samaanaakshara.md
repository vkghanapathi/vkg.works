category: analytical
abstract: A philological and exegetical treatment of Pāṇini's Śikṣāsūtra aphorism
  on homophonic vowels (samānākṣarāṇi), establishing that the first nine vowels of
  the Sanskrit phonetic inventory constitute a formal category distinguished by their
  acoustical and articulatory properties. The work provides multiple interpretive
  layers—Mādhavīya-vṛtti, Trivandrum commentary, and Vaiyākaraṇa analysis—to clarify
  the nomenclatural principles underlying vowel classification and the hermeneutical
  justification for grouping short and long variants as svarṇa (homoorganic) pairs.
preamble: This analytical work belongs to the Sanskrit grammatical and phonological
  tradition (Śikṣā), specifically engaging with the foundational phonetic systematisation
  of Pāṇini's aphoristic sutras. The Śikṣā (Phonetics) represents one of the six Vedāṅgas
  (auxiliary disciplines to Vedic study) and provides the technical framework for
  understanding Sanskrit sound-production, classification, and combinatorial principles
  essential to ritual correctness and textual transmission. Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī's
  analytical apparatus applies three traditional exegetical schools to illuminate
  the philosophical and practical reasoning underlying Pāṇini's nomenclatural categories.
