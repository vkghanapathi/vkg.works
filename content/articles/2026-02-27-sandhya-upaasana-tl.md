abstract: An analytical treatment of Sandhyāvandanam, the foundational daily worship
  ritual performed at dawn, noon, and dusk in Vedic Hindu practice. The work examines
  the etymological basis of the term, the doctrine of threefold purification (trikāraṇa-śuddhi)
  of mind, speech, and action, and the soteriological necessity of this observance
  for removing accumulated karmic impurity and enabling efficacy of all other ritual
  obligations.
preamble: Sandhyāvandanam belongs to the nityakarma (daily obligatory rites) category
  of Vedic practice, prescribed in the Dharmaśāstra tradition for all initiated individuals
  regardless of social distinction. Performed at the junctures between night and day,
  this ritual embodies the principle that bodily and mental purification through regulated
  practice serves as the indispensable foundation upon which all subsequent religious
  and secular actions acquire validity and efficacy. The work situates this practice
  within broader Vedic conceptions of temporal consciousness and the reciprocal influence
  of celestial bodies upon human physiology and cognition.
