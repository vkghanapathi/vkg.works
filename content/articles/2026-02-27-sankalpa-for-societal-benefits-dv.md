status: draft
category: analytical
abstract: An analytical examination of *sankalpa* (sacred intention or resolve) as
  a mechanism for generating positive social outcomes and collective benefit. This
  work explores how the ritualistic and philosophical concept of sankalpa operates
  within Hindu practice to create ethical and material benefits for society beyond
  individual spiritual gains.
preamble: Within Hindu ritual and philosophical traditions, *sankalpa* represents
  a formal declaration of intent that precedes most Vedic ceremonies and daily devotional
  practices. Rooted in the Vedas and extensively elaborated in the Dharmaśāstra and
  Purāṇic literature, sankalpa functions as both a binding verbal formula and a metaphysical
  act of will that aligns individual consciousness with cosmic order (*ṛta*). Dr.
  Ghanapāṭhī's analytical treatment extends this classical understanding toward contemporary
  social ethics, demonstrating how traditional ritual intention-setting addresses
  modern concerns of collective welfare and societal transformation.
