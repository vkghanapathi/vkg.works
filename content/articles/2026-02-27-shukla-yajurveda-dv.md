abstract: An analytical exposition of the Śukla Yajurveda that traces the textual
  transmission and branching of the Yajurvedic tradition through the narrative of
  Yājñavalkya's discipleship under Vaiśampāyana. The work synthesizes purāṇic sources—particularly
  the Viṣṇu Purāṇa, Brahmaṇḍa Purāṇa, and Bhāgavata Purāṇa—to establish the canonical
  enumeration of Yajurvedic recensions and their respective authorial lineages, with
  special emphasis on the śākhā (branch) divisions and the śuddha (pure) Yajurvedic
  corpus.
preamble: 'This article belongs to the Vedic textual commentary tradition and examines
  the Yajurveda—the second of the four Vedas, characterized by its sacrificial (yājñik)
  function in Vedic ritual. The Yajurveda is conventionally divided into two major
  recensions: the Śukla (White) and the Kṛṣṇa (Black), with further subdivision into
  multiple śākhās or schools of transmission. This piece specifically analyzes the
  Śukla Yajurveda through the legendary account of Yājñavalkya, the Upaniṣadic sage
  and transmitter, whose dispute with his teacher Vaiśampāyana—over observance of
  the brahmahattyā-vrata (atonement for Brahmin-slaying)—resulted in the regurgitation
  and reorganization of Yajurvedic mantras that constitute the Taittirīya and Vājasaneyi
  śākhās.'
