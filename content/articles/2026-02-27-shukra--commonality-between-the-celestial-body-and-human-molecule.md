abstract: A phenomenological treatise examining structural homologies between celestial
  mechanics (specifically Venus/Śukra's orbital behaviour) and biological reproductive
  processes (Śukra Dhātu in Ayurvedic physiology). The work employs the classical
  Indic methodology of Bandhu (correspondence) to establish isomorphic principles
  of constrained potency, rejecting causal or mechanistic frameworks in favour of
  a fractal model wherein universal laws of motion and governance manifest identically
  across macrocosmic and microcosmic scales.
preamble: This work situates itself within the Indic philosophical and medical tradition
  that treats the cosmos and human body as microcosm-macrocosm correlates, a foundational
  principle in Vedic knowledge systems. Drawing on Jyotiṣa (mathematical astronomy),
  Ayurveda (classical medicine), and Vedantic philosophy, it applies the ancient hermeneutical
  tool of Bandhu—the recognition of binding structural connections between disparate
  phenomena—to bridge astronomy and reproductive biology. Rather than accepting modern
  reductionist causality, the work retrieves the phenomenological rigour of classical
  Indian natural philosophy.
