title: 1. The Physics of "Burning" (Dahana)
date: '2026-02-27'
author: Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī
status: draft
abstract: This article develops a phenomenological comparison of planetary motion
  (specifically Venus/Śukra in retrograde states) and human reproductive physiology,
  arguing for structural and pattern-based analogies across different scales of observation.
  Rather than asserting causal mechanisms, the work traces how motion, restraint,
  attraction, and trajectory function as comparable modes of unfolding in both astronomical
  and biological contexts, grounding this inquiry in classical Indic methods of pattern
  recognition (Ṛta-based thinking) and Jyotiṣa as a phenomenology of experience.
preamble: This work situates itself within the Jyotiṣa (Vedic astrology) tradition
  and the broader classical Indic epistemic framework that privileges structural analogy
  and pattern-recognition across domains of knowledge rather than linear causation.
  Drawing on the concept of Śukra (Venus as both planetary body and principle of generative
  fluid in Āyurvedic anthropology), the author engages a methodological approach rooted
  in Vedic Ṛta (cosmic order) thinking, which permits meaningful comparison of phenomena
  across scales—celestial, biological, and experiential—without reducing one domain
  to the mechanism of another.
