abstract: This phenomenological study examines structural correspondences between
  the planet Venus (Śukra) in classical Indian astronomy and the reproductive tissue
  (śukra dhātu) in Ayurvedic biology through the framework of Bandhu—the Vedic principle
  of binding connections between macrocosm and microcosm. Rather than proposing causal
  mechanisms, the work identifies shared patterns of motion, thermodynamic regulation,
  and generative potential across celestial and biological scales, demonstrating how
  Jyotiṣa encodes a coherent pattern-grammar of generation.
preamble: This work is situated within the classical Indic philosophical and scientific
  traditions that treat astronomy (Jyotiṣa), medicine (Āyurveda), and metaphysics
  as integrated knowledge systems. It draws on the Vedic cosmological principle of
  Bandhu—the correspondence between different levels of reality—and applies it to
  contemporary interdisciplinary study. The analysis engages historical texts on planetary
  motion and tissue physiology, treating Jyotiṣa not as mechanistic prediction but
  as a phenomenological reading of natural patterns and cycles that govern both celestial
  and biological experience.
