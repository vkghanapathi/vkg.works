abstract: This phenomenological study examines structural correspondences between
  Venus (Śukra) as a celestial body and śukra dhātu (reproductive essence) in the
  human microcosm, using the classical Indic framework of Bandhu (macrocosm-microcosm
  binding). Through analysis of shared patterns in motion, viscosity, thermal regulation,
  and temporal cycles, the work demonstrates how Jyotiṣa encodes experiential and
  morphological archetypes rather than causal mechanisms, offering a coherence hypothesis
  grounded in observable pattern rather than mechanistic explanation.
preamble: This work situates itself within the classical Indic intellectual tradition
  that understands the cosmos through structural homology rather than linear causation.
  Drawing on Jyotiṣa (Vedic astrology), Āyurveda (classical medicine), and the Bandhu
  doctrine found in Vedic and Puranic literature, the study treats Venus not as an
  astrological determinant but as a phenomenological mode—a pattern of motion and
  restraint that recurs across celestial and biological scales. This approach is rooted
  in the pre-Cartesian Indian epistemology that reads correspondence and analogy as
  legitimate forms of knowledge, finding coherence through structural grammar rather
  than mechanism.
