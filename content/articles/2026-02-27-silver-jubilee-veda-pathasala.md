abstract: An administrative announcement and appeal for the Silver Jubilee Celebrations
  (1985–2010) of Sri Ganapati Sachchidananda Veda Pathasala, a Vedic education institution
  affiliated with Avadhoota Datta Peetham. The document outlines the institution's
  achievements in Vedic pedagogy, lists commemorative events including alumni recognition,
  scholarly discourses, and ritual performances, and solicits support from devotees
  and patrons to sustain the school's mission of preserving Vedic knowledge and dharmic
  practice.
preamble: This work situates itself within the modern institutional framework of Vedic
  preservation and ritual practice in the Datta tradition, a sampradāya centred on
  the worship of Dattatreya as the embodiment of the Vedas and guru-principle. The
  Veda Pathasala represents a contemporary effort to maintain traditional Vedic recitation
  (ghanapāṭha), textual scholarship (śāstra), and Vedic ritual (śrouta-iṣṭi) within
  an ashram setting. The document reflects the confluence of traditional gurukula
  pedagogy with institutional administration, demonstrating how classical Vedic transmission
  continues through formal education, examination systems, and donor networks in twenty-first-century
  Hindu institutional practice.
