abstract: This analytical work presents a systematic framework demonstrating how Vedic
  philosophical principles address contemporary societal challenges including environmental
  degradation, unemployment, inequality, and resource management. Through comparative
  valuation of Vedic solutions across pure science, applied sciences, health sciences,
  and social sciences, the author argues for the revival of traditional dharmic concepts—particularly
  swadharma (one's rightful duty) and fundamental human rights—as practical remedies
  to modern crises, accompanied by sustainable lifestyle practices rooted in core
  Vedic values.
preamble: This work situates itself within the broader Vedic intellectual tradition,
  drawing upon the Upaniṣads and Bhagavad Gītā—foundational texts of Hindu philosophy
  that address dharma (righteous duty), social order, and the relationship between
  individual conduct and collective welfare. The analysis invokes classical Vedic
  concepts of varṇa (social classification by aptitude), āśrama (life stages), and
  the principle of Brahmaasmi (the identity of individual consciousness with ultimate
  reality) as frameworks for understanding both metaphysical and practical solutions
  to contemporary problems. The work engages with SV Vedic University's institutional
  commitment to demonstrating the continued relevance of Vedic wisdom to modern scientific
  and social discourse.
