abstract: A Sanskrit devotional poem in Śārdūlavikrīḍita meter composed as a tribute
  to Sri Rama Yogeswara Sharma (Chaganti Rama Jogeswara Rao), expressing the transcendence
  of embodied consciousness into non-dual realization. The work synthesizes Advaita
  Vedānta philosophy with personal devotion, employing classical prosody to articulate
  the renunciation of phenomenal existence and awakening to Brahman consciousness.
preamble: This work belongs to the Sanskrit devotional-philosophical tradition rooted
  in Advaita Vedānta, the non-dualistic school of Vedāntic interpretation attributed
  to Śaṅkara. The poem exemplifies the genre of personal spiritual tribute expressed
  through sophisticated classical meters, drawing on the Upaniṣadic mahāvākya "Brahmasmi"
  (I am Brahman) as its philosophical foundation. It reflects a longstanding Hindu
  practice of honoring realized spiritual teachers (gurus) through Sanskrit verse,
  combining scholarly precision in prosody with meditative inquiry into the nature
  of self and ultimate reality.
