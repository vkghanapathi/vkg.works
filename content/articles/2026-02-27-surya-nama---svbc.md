title: सूर्याः आदित्याः

author: Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī
status: draft
category: analytical
abstract: An analytical exposition of the Adityas (solar deities) and their correspondence
  to cosmic and functional principles in Vedic cosmology. The work systematizes the
  twelve Ādityas—beginning with Indra/Vishnu and concluding with Kashyapa—through
  etymological analysis, ritual application, and philosophical interpretation of their
  names and attributive powers. Dr. Ghanapāṭhī demonstrates how the plurality of solar
  manifestations represents unified solar energy differentiated across seven wind-currents
  (vāyu-skandha) and their effects on worldly phenomena, substantiating a sophisticated
  exegetical tradition within Vedic hermeneutics.
preamble: This work operates within the Vedic ritual and cosmological framework, specifically
  engaging with the theology of the Adityas as presented in the Rig Veda and developed
  through Vedic hermeneutical texts (nirukta). The Adityas occupy a central position
  in Vedic metaphysics as manifestations of solar divinity responsible for cosmic
  order (ṛta), sustenance, and liberation. The author's methodology combines Pāṇinian
  linguistic analysis, Vedic exegesis, and ritual application (prayoga) to establish
  the doctrinal coherence of these deities, situating their multiple names not as
  separate entities but as functional expressions of singular solar principle operating
  across different cosmological and physiological domains.
