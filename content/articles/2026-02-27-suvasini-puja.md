abstract: This technical article provides a philosophical and etymological analysis
  of Suvasini Puja, a devotional practice performed by women during Srichakra worship.
  The work examines the term 'suvasini' (auspicious lady) through multiple frameworks—domestic
  virtue, goddess worship, and Tantric philosophy—arguing that the ritual's significance
  lies in cultivating pure mental perceptions (suvasana) that lead to both familial
  welfare and spiritual advancement. The article contextualizes the practice within
  the Lalita Sahasranama, demonstrating how Suvasini Puja exemplifies the relationship
  between external ritual conduct and internal psychological refinement.
preamble: Suvasini Puja belongs to the Tantric and Shakta traditions of Hindu worship,
  particularly as observed in Srichakra rituals dedicated to the Divine Feminine.
  In Hindu domestic spirituality, the suvasini—the well-mannered housewife—holds sacred
  status as the guardian of the household's spiritual fire (agni) and ritual center.
  This practice draws upon classical Sanskrit concepts of feminine dharma while integrating
  interpretations from the Lalita Sahasranama, the thousand names of the Goddess,
  which constitute a central devotional text in Shakta tradition. The article bridges
  Vedic household rituals with Tantric philosophy, presenting Suvasini Puja as both
  a practical family blessing and a framework for psychological and spiritual purification.
