title: STEP 2 — FORMAL ALGORITHM FOR SWARA DETECTION
date: '2026-02-27'
author: Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī
status: draft
category: analytical
abstract: This analytical work presents a formal algorithm for Swara detection in
  Vedic recitation, arguing that Swara functions as a semantic principle rather than
  merely musical intonation. Dr. Ghanapathi establishes that Swara is intrinsic to
  vowels (Ach) alone and systematically examines the etymologies, functions, and structural
  roles of Udātta, Anudātta, Swarita, and Pracaya—the four fundamental Swara states—demonstrating
  how they govern meaning preservation and phonetic transformation in Vedic texts.
preamble: In the Vedic tradition of Sanskrit recitation, Swara (prosodic accent) constitutes
  one of the six Vedāṅgas (auxiliary disciplines) essential for preserving the sanctity
  and intelligibility of the Vedas. The formal system of Swara marking evolved to
  maintain textual integrity across millennia of oral transmission. This work situates
  Swara not as external melodic ornamentation but as an integral phonetic and semantic
  property embedded within the vowel system, thereby addressing a fundamental misunderstanding
  in popular Vedic pedagogy and grounding Swara analysis in classical Shastric principles
  of phonology and grammatical function.
