abstract: An analytical examination of how invocations (āhvāna) to deities are received
  and efficacious in Vedic ritual practice. Dr. Ghanapāṭhī addresses the devotee's
  fundamental question of whether divine beings hear prayers and invocations made
  from a distance, grounding his analysis in specific Vedic mantras from the Rigveda
  and Yajurveda, and addressing practical concerns that arise in daily worship (nitya-pūjā)
  and sacrificial performance (yajña).
preamble: This work belongs to the tradition of Vedic ritual exegesis and belongs
  to the broader field of Vedic mantra interpretation (veda-mantra-bodha). Drawing
  on the Rigvedic Śākala recension and the Yajurvedic Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, the author
  examines the theological and practical dimensions of deity invocation in Śrauta
  and Smārta ritual contexts. The essay addresses doubts commonly experienced by practitioners
  of daily worship and yajna performance, providing scriptural justification for preparatory
  invocation rituals (anvārambhaṇa) and their efficacy.
