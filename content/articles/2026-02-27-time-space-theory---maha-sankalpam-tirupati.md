abstract: This technical article by Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapathi examines the cosmological
  and temporal dimensions encoded within the Maha Sankalpa, the solemn declaration
  recited during Vedic marriage rituals. The work demonstrates how traditional Sankalpa
  formulations—which specify spatial location, temporal coordinates, ritual procedure,
  and human intention—embed a sophisticated vision of cosmic structure and the place
  of humanity within a multiversal framework, and argues that this Vedic understanding
  anticipates modern astrophysical concepts regarding the multiverse and the relational
  nature of space-time.
preamble: The Sankalpa is a foundational liturgical element of Vedic ritual practice,
  wherein the ritualist explicitly declares his identity, purpose, place, and time
  before performing any sacred act. The Maha Sankalpa—performed at Vivaha (marriage)
  ceremonies and recited by the bride's father—holds particular cosmological significance
  within Hindu tradition, as it frames the marriage act as sustaining human continuity
  and situates this continuity within the vast temporal and spatial order of creation.
  This article contextualizes the Sankalpa within the broader Vedic epistemology of
  Desha (space) and Kaala (time), and positions it as a sophisticated proto-scientific
  formulation that merits comparison with contemporary Western physics.
