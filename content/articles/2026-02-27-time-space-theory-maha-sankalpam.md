abstract: This technical article examines the Vedic cosmological framework governing
  universal creation and destruction cycles, specifically the temporal structure of
  Brahma's lifespan and the subdivision of cosmic time into hierarchical units (Kalpas,
  Manvantaras, and Yugas). The author presents a syncretic interpretation of traditional
  Vedic chronology alongside contemporary scientific paradigms (Big Bang cosmology),
  establishing correspondences between sacred time measurements and modern astrophysical
  concepts.
preamble: This work operates within the broader Hindu cosmological tradition as articulated
  in the Vedas and Puranic literature, particularly the framework of the Trimurti
  (Trinity) comprising Brahma the Creator, Vishnu the Maintainer, and Shiva the Destroyer.
  The article draws upon classical Vedic accounts of cosmic cyclicity—the notion that
  the material universe undergoes repeated cycles of emergence and dissolution across
  vast temporal scales. This cosmological model is foundational to Hindu metaphysics
  and represents one of the earliest systematic attempts in human civilization to
  mathematize the structure of time itself.
