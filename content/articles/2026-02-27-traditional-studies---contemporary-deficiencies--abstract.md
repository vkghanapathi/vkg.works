category: technical
abstract: 'This article diagnoses fundamental deficiencies in contemporary Vedic preservation
  and transmission, arguing that superficial institutional support masks deeper failures
  in textual scholarship and interpretive methodology. The author proposes a threefold
  remedial framework: protection of the core Vedic text (Shabdaatmaka Veda Pari Rakshana),
  preservation of authentic interpretive methodology via Vedangas and ancillary texts
  (Arthaatmaka Veda Pari Rakshana), and systematic propagation of Vedic philosophy
  to modern academic disciplines and future generations.'
preamble: 'This work situates itself within the Vedic preservation tradition (Sanatana
  Dharma) that has historically relied on strict pedagogical protocols and oral transmission
  to maintain textual integrity across millennia. The author engages with the classical
  Vedic auxiliary sciences (Vedangas)—traditionally understood as essential interpretive
  instruments—to address what he identifies as a contemporary crisis: the separation
  of ritualistic practice from foundational scriptural knowledge. His critique assumes
  familiarity with the distinction between Veda (source scripture) and Shastra (methodological
  texts), and with the role of trained practitioners (Purohits, Pundits) in maintaining
  philosophical and linguistic fidelity to inherited knowledge systems.'
