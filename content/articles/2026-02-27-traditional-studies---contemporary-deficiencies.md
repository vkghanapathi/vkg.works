abstract: A comprehensive technical and preservation framework addressing the dual
  challenge of maintaining Vedic textual integrity (Śabdātmaka) and interpretive methodology
  (Arthātmaka) in the modern era. Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapaathi outlines systemic
  deficiencies in current publishing and pedagogy, proposes actionable solutions for
  accurate Vedic dissemination, and contextualizes preservation efforts within the
  custodial traditions (Sampradāya) of Śanatana Dharma.
preamble: This work emerges from the Vedic preservation tradition (Veda-Rakṣaṇa),
  a continuous practice spanning millennia wherein Ācāryas have maintained the Vedas—the
  foundational scriptures of Indian civilization—through rigorous oral transmission,
  standardized pronunciation practices (Uchchāraṇa), and systematic pedagogical methods.
  The four Vedas (Ṛg, Yajur, Sāma, Atharva) form the epistemological and liturgical
  basis of Sanātana Dharma, and their accurate transmission depends equally on textual
  fidelity and correct interpretive frameworks (Vedāṅga and Upāṅga disciplines). Ghanapaathi's
  treatise directly addresses the contemporary crisis in which superficial institutional
  support for Vedic practice obscures the absence of robust infrastructure for authentic
  textual scholarship and priestly training.
