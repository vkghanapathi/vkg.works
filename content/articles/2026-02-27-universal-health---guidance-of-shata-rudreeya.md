category: analytical
abstract: This analytical article examines contemporary health and social wellness
  through the lens of the Śatarudríya (Rudra Adhyāya) of the Yajurveda, proposing
  that Vedic prayer traditions offer essential perspective on universal well-being
  beyond technological advancement. The author argues that the cultivation of virtuous
  speech and ethical consciousness, as prescribed in Vedic hymns, forms the foundational
  basis for health at individual and collective levels, connecting linguistic and
  psychological discipline to the prevention of social strife and disease.
preamble: The Śatarudríya, comprising the Rudra Adhyāya of the Yajurveda, is a celebrated
  hymnic cycle dedicated to Rudra (Śiva) as the cosmic principle of transformation
  and renewal. Rooted in Vedic ritual and devotional practice, these hymns have been
  preserved through the oral tradition of Vedic chanting (ghanapāṭha) for millennia.
  The present work situates contemporary concerns regarding technology, public discourse,
  and social health within the framework of Vedic cosmology and the prayer for *ayakṣma*
  (freedom from disease) and universal *kuśala* (well-being), demonstrating the continued
  relevance of these ancient traditions to modern challenges.
