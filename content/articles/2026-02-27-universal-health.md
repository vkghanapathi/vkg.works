abstract: An analytical article examining the principles and applications of universal
  health within the framework of Vedic and classical Indian philosophical traditions.
  This work investigates how ancient Indian medical and wellness systems address health
  as an integrated aspect of human flourishing, connecting physical well-being to
  cosmic and spiritual principles.
preamble: This article draws on the Vedic tradition and classical Indian medical sciences,
  particularly Āyurveda, which conceives of health not as the absence of disease but
  as a harmonious balance of bodily elements (dhātus), vital energies (prāṇa), and
  constitutional types (prakṛti). The work situates individual health within broader
  cosmological frameworks found in the Upaniṣads and philosophical schools, reflecting
  the Hindu understanding that wellness encompasses physical, mental, and spiritual
  dimensions aligned with natural law (ṛta) and individual dharma.
