abstract: This technical article examines the philosophical and ethical relevance
  of the Upaniṣads—the foundational metaphysical texts of Vedic Hinduism—to contemporary
  social, cultural, and institutional challenges. The work argues for the continued
  applicability of Upaniṣadic thought as a framework for understanding modern society
  and addressing its complexities.
preamble: The Upaniṣads form the philosophical backbone of Hindu metaphysics and constitute
  the Vedānta tradition, which seeks ultimate knowledge (brahmavidyā) of the absolute
  reality (Brahman). Composed between roughly 1500 and 500 BCE, these texts move beyond
  ritualistic prescriptions to explore the nature of consciousness, the self (ātman),
  and the relationship between the individual and the universal. This article positions
  the Upaniṣads not as historical artifacts but as living wisdom applicable to contemporary
  social institutions and collective life.
