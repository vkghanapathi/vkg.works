author: Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī
status: draft
category: technical
abstract: A technical exposition on the principle of vāyu (air/wind) as the primordial
  manifest form of Brahman in Vedic cosmology. Dr. Ghanapāṭhī systematically examines
  vāyu's role in creation (sṛṣṭi-krama), its relationship to other cosmic principles
  (tejas, jala, pṛthvī), and its governance of ākāśa (space), drawing on Upaniṣadic
  and Brāhmaṇa sources to establish vāyu as the first element accessible to human
  sense perception and as the basis for proper ritual devotion (vāyu-upāsanā).
preamble: This work situates vāyu within the Vedic metaphysical framework, particularly
  the sequential manifestation of cosmic elements from Brahman as described in the
  Upaniṣads and associated Brāhmaṇa literature. The author engages the Śvetāśvatara
  and Taittirīya traditions, as well as the Darśapūrṇamāsa-brāhmaṇa and Chāturhhotra-brāhmaṇa,
  to demonstrate how vāyu functions both as a cosmological principle and as an object
  of meditative worship (upāsanā). The essay reflects the author's scholarly approach
  to reconciling Vedic pneumatology with observable natural phenomena, including references
  to oxygen and nitrogen as modern scientific correlates of Vedic conceptual categories.
