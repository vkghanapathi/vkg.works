title: स्वाध्यायान्मा प्रमदः
date: '2026-02-27'
author: Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī
status: draft
category: analytical
abstract: A critical essay examining the degradation of public discourse in contemporary
  society, particularly the proliferation of sensationalism over substantive truth
  in media, social platforms, and public speech. The author argues for recovery of
  dharmic principles—especially the notion of svadharma (one's proper duty)—as an
  antidote to the erosion of intellectual and ethical standards, drawing on Vedantic
  and Bhagavad Gītā philosophy to establish that differentiation of roles and duties,
  not egalitarian uniformity, sustains social and spiritual wellbeing.
preamble: This work draws from the Advaita Vedānta tradition and the Bhagavad Gītā,
  specifically invoking the concept of svadharma (individual duty according to one's
  station) as a foundational principle for ethical conduct. The essay is situated
  within the broader Vedic intellectual framework that recognizes the vipra (Brahmin
  scholar-priest) as a custodian of knowledge and discriminative wisdom. The author
  employs traditional categories such as śrotriya (one learned in Vedic recitation)
  and references the sacred duty of self-study (svādhyāya) to frame contemporary social
  decay as a departure from Vedic dharmic principles.
