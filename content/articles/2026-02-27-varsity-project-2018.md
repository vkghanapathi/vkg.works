abstract: A foundational document outlining Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī's comprehensive
  framework for the preservation and transmission of Vedic knowledge in contemporary
  contexts. The work establishes dual preservation strategies—Śabdātmaka Veda Parirakṣaṇa
  (textual and phonetic preservation) and Arthātmaka Veda Parirakṣaṇa (interpretive
  and methodological preservation)—alongside institutional models for integrating
  Vedic education with modern pedagogy, particularly through the proposed Project
  Vedārtha.
preamble: This preamble is situated within the Sanātana Dharma tradition and addresses
  the institutional transmission of the four Vedas, their auxiliary texts (Upaveda,
  Vedāṅga, Darśana), and related Sanskrit philosophical literature. It responds to
  contemporary challenges in Vedic preservation by articulating the multivalent significance
  of Vedic knowledge—encompassing mantra recitation, semantic interpretation, ritual
  application (Archaka and Purohit functions), aesthetic forms (poetry, music, dance),
  and philosophical methodology. The work acknowledges the historical role of Ācāryas
  in maintaining textual purity across generations and proposes modern institutional
  structures to sustain this lineage.
