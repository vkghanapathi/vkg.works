abstract: A foundational document outlining a comprehensive institutional framework
  for the preservation and transmission of Vedic knowledge in both its textual and
  interpretive dimensions. The work proposes dual preservation strategies—Śabdātmaka
  (phonetic/recitation-based) and Arthātmaka (meaning-based/interpretive)—alongside
  educational programs integrating Vedic studies with modern scientific curricula
  and vocational training.
preamble: This preamble situates itself within the Sanātana Dharma tradition and the
  broader Vedic heritage preservation movement in contemporary India. It addresses
  the foundational role of the four Vedas, their allied texts (Upaveds, Vedāngas,
  Darśanas), and their multivalent significance as sources of wisdom, ritual efficacy,
  philosophical depth, and cultural identity. The work emerges from the institutional
  concern—rooted in the Vedic transmission lineage maintained by traditional Ācāryās—to
  ensure the continuity of Vedic knowledge and praxis in an era of institutional formalization
  and educational pluralism.
