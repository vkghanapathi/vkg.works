abstract: A foundational analytical treatise examining the definition, characteristics,
  and divisions of the Veda. The work systematically addresses core epistemological
  questions—what constitutes the Veda, its purpose, defining characteristics, authority,
  and qualification for study—while establishing the Veda's twofold structure (mantra
  and Brāhmaṇa) and its fivefold categorical divisions (mantra, vidhi, niṣedha, nāmadheyā,
  and arthavāda). This work exemplifies rigorous scriptural exegesis grounded in classical
  Mīmāṃsā methodology.
preamble: Vedic literature constitutes the foundational corpus of Indic knowledge
  and spiritual authority within Hindu philosophical tradition. The Veda—comprising
  the Ṛg, Yajur, Sāma, and Atharva Vedas—is traditionally understood as self-revealed
  (apauruṣeya) knowledge accessible through systematic study and ritual practice.
  Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī's analytical introduction grounds Vedic study in the
  interpretive frameworks established by classical exegetes including Sāyaṇācārya,
  Uvvaṭa, and the Jaiminīya school of Pūrva Mīmāṃsā, thereby providing structured
  access to Vedic texts for contemporary readers.
