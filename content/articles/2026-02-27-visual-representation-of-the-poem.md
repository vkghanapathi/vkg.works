title: '### Visual Representation of the Poem’s Themes'
date: '2026-02-27'
author: Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī
status: draft
category: analytical
abstract: This analytical article presents a visual schematic representation of Advaita
  Vedanta philosophical themes embedded in a devotional poem by Dr. Vamshi Krishna
  Ghanapathi, structured as a Graphviz diagram that traces the soteriological journey
  from avidyā (ignorance) to mokṣa (liberation). The diagram contextualizes the poet's
  personal tribute to his spiritual guide, Sri Rama Yogeswara, within classical Advaita
  metaphysics, demonstrating how contemporary scholarly methodology can elucidate
  traditional philosophical narratives.
preamble: This work operates within the Advaita Vedānta tradition, the non-dualistic
  philosophical school systematized by Ādi Śaṅkara, which understands brahman as the
  singular, transcendent reality and the individual ātman as ultimately identical
  with brahman. The analytical framework invokes core Advaita concepts—avidyā (primal
  ignorance), māyā (cosmic illusion), and mokṣa (liberation through jñāna or self-knowledge)—while
  grounding them in the lived devotional experience of guru-disciple transmission.
  By mapping these abstract metaphysical principles onto a genealogical structure
  centered on the teacher-student relationship, the work bridges classical textual
  exegesis with contemporary academic and spiritual practice.
