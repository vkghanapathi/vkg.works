abstract: An analytical exposition of Bharatīya Vivāha (Hindu marriage) that systematically
  presents its definition, purpose within the dharmic framework, and comprehensive
  ceremonial structure. The work delineates eight classical marriage types recognized
  in Hindu law and traces the complete ritual sequence from pre-matrimonial rites
  through post-ceremonial observances, demonstrating how marriage functions as a socio-religious
  institution for perpetuating dharma across generations.
preamble: 'This lecture draws upon the Dharmaśāstra tradition, particularly the vivāha
  (marriage) protocols established in classical Sanskrit texts such as the Manusmṛti
  and regional Śāstra commentaries. Hindu marriage (vivāha) occupies a central place
  in the Vedic framework as one of the Saṁskāras (life-cycle rituals) and a primary
  vehicle for fulfilling three of the Puruṣa Arthas (human goals): dharma, artha,
  and kāma. The eight marriage types (Brāhma, Prājāpatya, Ārsha, Daiva, Gāndharvā,
  Āsura, Rākshasa, and Paishācha) represent graduated ethical and social hierarchies
  recognized across Hindu legal literature. Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī''s exposition
  contextualizes these classical categories alongside the detailed ritual sequence
  (Maṅgalya Dhāraṇa, Saptapadi, Agni Sākshya, and related homas) as practised in Vedic
  tradition.'
