abstract: A comprehensive exposition of Kalyanam (the auspicious ritual of divine
  marriage) as both a literal institutional practice and a metaphysical framework
  for understanding universal creation. Dr. Ghanapathi grounds the concept in classical
  sources including the Brahma Vaivarta Purana and Soundarya Lahari, demonstrating
  how the sacred union of Shiva and Shakti—or more broadly, Purusha and Prakriti—represents
  the dynamic interplay necessary for cosmic manifestation and sustenance.
preamble: This article examines Kalyanam within the Hindu ritual and philosophical
  tradition, where it functions simultaneously as an annual temple observance (Devata
  Kalyanam) celebrating the marriage of deities and as a symbolic representation of
  metaphysical principles. Rooted in Tantric and Vedantic philosophy, the practice
  illustrates how abstract principles of creation—the union of consciousness (Shiva/Purusha)
  and primordial energy (Shakti/Prakriti/Maya)—are made accessible to devotees through
  mythological narrative (Avatara Katha) and ritual procedure (Sankalpam). The work
  positions Kalyanam as a bridge between formless transcendence (Nirguna Brahman)
  and manifest reality (Saguna Brahman), embodying core Hindu theological concepts
  of form, name, and divine incarnation.
