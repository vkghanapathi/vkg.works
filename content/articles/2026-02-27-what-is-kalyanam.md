abstract: This technical article by Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī examines Kalyanam
  (marriage and initiation ritual) as both a social institution and a metaphysical
  principle rooted in Hindu philosophy. The work traces the conceptual foundations
  of Kalyanam from practical family union through to its theological representation
  of Śiva-Śakti cosmology, demonstrating how Vedic ritual embodies abstract principles
  of universal creation and sustenance through performed liturgy.
preamble: Within the broader Tantric and Vedantic Hindu tradition, Kalyanam functions
  simultaneously as a domestic rite of passage and a devotional commemoration of divine
  union. The essay situates marriage and temple festivals (Devata Kalyanam) within
  the philosophical framework of Advaita and Śakta theology, particularly drawing
  on the Brahma Vaivarta Purāṇa and the Śoundaryalaharī to explain how finite, embodied
  ritual practice communicates transcendent metaphysical truths about the relationship
  between static Brahman (Śiva) and creative cosmic energy (Śakti/Māyā). This interpretive
  approach reflects the classical Hindu understanding that all religious observance
  necessarily embodies higher philosophical principles through symbolic action and
  mantric utterance.
