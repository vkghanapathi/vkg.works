abstract: This analytical article presents a geographical mapping system that correlates
  classical Vedic and Puranic cosmography with modern world geography. Dr. Ghanapāṭhī
  identifies the seven continents (dvīpas) and their subdivisions (talas) as described
  in Hindu scriptures with contemporary landmasses, proposing that the Jambudvīpa
  comprises Asia, while Plaksha, Kusha, Shalmali, Shaka, Krauncha, and Pushkara correspond
  to Europe, Africa, and the Americas. The work demonstrates systematic correlation
  between ancient Sanskrit geographical nomenclature and modern geographical coordinates.
preamble: This work draws from the Puranic cosmographical framework, particularly
  as outlined in texts such as the Viṣṇu Purāṇa and Bhāgavata Purāṇa, which describe
  the earth as a lotus with four petals (mahā-khanda) divided by oceans. The Ujjain
  meridian, established as the prime reference point in classical Indian astronomy
  and geography, serves as the central organizing principle. This article belongs
  to the tradition of Vedic geographical study (bhūgola-śāstra) and represents a modern
  scholarly attempt to harmonize scriptural cosmology with contemporary geographical
  knowledge.
