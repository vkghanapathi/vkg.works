category: analytical
abstract: 'This analytical article presents detailed specifications for two major
  Vedic ritual performances: the Srirama Taaraka Ramayana Maha Yajna and the Vairaaja
  Maha Narayana Yajna. The work documents the structural organization, participant
  requirements, liturgical components, and theological foundations of these elaborate
  yajnas, with particular attention to the role of Purusha Sukta recitation and the
  cosmological understanding of Viraat (the cosmic form) and Narayana in Vedic worship.'
preamble: This work situates itself within the living tradition of Vedic ritual practice
  (yajna) and Vedantic philosophy. The yajnas described represent contemporary implementations
  of ancient Vedic protocols found across all four Vedas (Rigveda, Yajurveda, Samaveda,
  and Atharva Veda), with particular emphasis on the metaphysical teachings of Purusha
  Sukta regarding cosmic creation and divine manifestation. The article bridges ritual
  procedure with philosophical inquiry, grounding devotional practice in scriptural
  exegesis while maintaining the traditional understanding that proper recitation
  (parayana) and oblation (homa) constitute forms of spiritual inquiry and cosmic
  participation.
