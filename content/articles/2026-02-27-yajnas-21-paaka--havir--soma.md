abstract: This analytical article by Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī examines the eight
  sacraments (saṃskāras) prescribed in the Gautama Dharmasūtra—garbhādhana, puṃsavana,
  sīmantonyana, jātakarma, nāmakaraṇa, annaprāśana, and chaulopanyana—tracing their
  ritual foundations and theological significance within Vedic domestic practice.
  The work contextualizes these life-cycle rituals alongside the five great sacrifices
  (pañcamahāyajñas) and the class of cooking sacrifices (pāka-yajñas), establishing
  the doctrinal framework that governs their performance and efficacy.
preamble: The Gautama Dharmasūtra, a foundational Vedic ritual and legal text belonging
  to the Sāmaveda tradition, codifies the obligatory rites and duties incumbent upon
  householders across all four āśramas (life-stages). This article examines how the
  sacramental system (saṃskāra-vidhi) serves as the primary mechanism for civilizing
  and purifying the individual from conception through initiation, working in concert
  with obligatory Vedic sacrifices. The discussion situates these sacraments within
  the broader taxonomy of Vedic ritual action, demonstrating how domestic rites constitute
  essential pathways to spiritual and social legitimacy in classical Hindu orthopraxy.
