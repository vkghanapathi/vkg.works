abstract: A devotional poem composed for the Plava Saṃvat (year 2021 CE) by Dr. Vamshi
  Krishna Ghanapāṭhī, offering benedictions and spiritual guidance for the new year.
  The work invokes divine protection from suffering and planetary malevolence while
  exhorting devotees to cultivate steadfast faith in the lotus feet of the Godhead,
  promising blessings of prosperity, peace, and spiritual energy through sincere prayer.
preamble: This composition participates in the Sanskrit tradition of auspicious new-year
  verses (śubhāśiṣaḥ), a centuries-old literary practice in Hindu calendrical observance.
  The Plava Saṃvat follows the traditional Hindu lunisolar calendar system; the poem
  combines astrological awareness (noting Mars/Kuja as the ruling planetary lord for
  a Tuesday-beginning year) with Bhakti philosophy, emphasizing devotional surrender
  (bhakti) to the divine as the remedy for worldly suffering and cosmic affliction.
  This genre exemplifies how classical Sanskrit composition serves contemporary spiritual
  and communal functions within the Hindu calendar tradition.
