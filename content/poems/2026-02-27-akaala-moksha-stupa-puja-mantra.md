title: अकाल मोक्षस्तूप पूजा मन्त्रः
date: '2026-02-27'
author: Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī
status: draft
abstract: A ritual mantra composed by Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī invoking divine
  intervention and liberation (mokṣa) for those who die prematurely or inauspiciously.
  The mantra addresses the suffering of those afflicted by divine calamities, untimely
  death, and spirits of the unrefined dead, petitioning their salvation through worship
  of the Akāla Mokṣa Stūpa (the memorial monument for untimely death).
preamble: This work belongs to the Hindu ritual and devotional tradition concerned
  with untimely or inauspicious death (akāla mṛtyu) and the welfare of restless spirits
  (pretas). In classical Sanskrit theology and tantric practice, those who die unexpectedly
  or without proper sacramental preparation (asaṃskṛta) are believed to require special
  propitiation and ritual intervention. This mantra invokes a stūpa (reliquary monument)
  dedicated to mokṣa (liberation) as a means of addressing collective suffering and
  delivering departed souls from spiritual torment. The work synthesizes Vedic invocatory
  language with devotional urgency, reflecting Dr. Ghanapāṭhī's engagement with memorial
  and soteriological themes in contemporary Hindu practice.
