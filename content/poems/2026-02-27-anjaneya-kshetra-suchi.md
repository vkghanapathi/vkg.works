abstract: A devotional poem invoking Hanumān (Anjaneya) across multiple sacred sites
  and cities throughout India, enumerating his manifestations and spiritual efficacy
  at each location. The work employs a geographic-liturgical structure to establish
  Hanumān's pan-Indian presence and protective powers, culminating in a daily invocation
  for the successful accomplishment of all endeavours (kārya-siddhi).
preamble: This poem belongs to the tradition of Hindu devotional literature (bhakti-kāvya)
  that celebrates localised manifestations of deities across pilgrimage sites and
  urban centres. Within the broader Sanskrit and regional devotional corpus, such
  works serve both liturgical and geographical functions, mapping sacred geography
  through praise of a singular deity's omnipresence. The poem's enumeration of Hanumān's
  forms and locations reflects the medieval and early-modern practice of establishing
  or recognising deity manifestations at diverse territorial and institutional sites,
  a practice central to Hindu pilgrimage tradition and regional religious identity.
