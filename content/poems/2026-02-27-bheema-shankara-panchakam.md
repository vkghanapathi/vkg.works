abstract: Bhīmaśaṅkar Pañcakam is a devotional stotra (hymn) of five verses composed
  by Vaṃśī Kṛṣṇa Ghanapāṭhī in praise of Bhīmaśaṅkara, one of the twelve principal
  Jyotirliṅgas of Śiva. The work employs classical Sanskrit poetic conventions to
  celebrate Śiva's fierce manifestation, his destruction of the Tripura demons, and
  his grace toward devotees, concluding with a phala-darśana (result of recitation)
  that promises darśana at the sacred site.
preamble: This hymn belongs to the śaiva bhakti tradition, specifically the Jyotirliṅga
  worship cult, which venerates twelve sacred manifestations of Śiva distributed across
  the Indian subcontinent. Bhīmaśaṅkara, located in the Western Ghats of Maharashtra,
  is celebrated as a site of both fierce cosmic power and boundless compassion. The
  stotra follows the traditional format of Sanskrit devotional poetry, combining narrative
  mythology (the slaying of the Tripura demons), theological exposition, and ritualistic
  invocation. The inclusion of vernacular Marathi and Sanskrit exegesis (anvayas and
  bhāva commentary) reflects the composite literary and pedagogical practices of modern
  Vedic scholarship in the Kannada region.
