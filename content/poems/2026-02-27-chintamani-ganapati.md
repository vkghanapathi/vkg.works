abstract: The Chintāmaṇi Gaṇeśa Pañcakam is a five-verse devotional hymn dedicated
  to Gaṇeśa (Vināyaka), presented bilingually in Telugu and Sanskrit with ritual instructions.
  Each verse invokes Gaṇeśa with epithets emphasizing his role as the remover of obstacles,
  bestower of blessings, and embodiment of wisdom, culminating in a declaration that
  recitation of these five verses fulfils the worshipper's desires without fail.
preamble: This work belongs to the tradition of Hindu devotional liturgy (pūjā) centred
  on Gaṇeśa, the elephant-headed deity revered as the remover of obstacles and lord
  of beginnings in the Śaiva and Smārta traditions. The text exemplifies the pañcaka
  (five-verse) hymnic form, a compact genre of ritual praise used in temple worship
  and personal devotion across South India. The inclusion of bilingual versions (Telugu
  and Devanāgarī Sanskrit) reflects the multilingual scholarly and devotional culture
  of the Indian peninsula, while the appended ritual instructions—specifying that
  five turns of a mālā (rosary) should precede pūjā commencement—indicate this text's
  functional role as a liturgical manual designed to ensure efficacy and spiritual
  benefit for the practitioner.
