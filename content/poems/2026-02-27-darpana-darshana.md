title: చతుర్వింశతి హోరాసు సమాచరిత కర్మణః।

status: draft
abstract: This poetic composition presents a twenty-four-hour horoscopic meditation
  on karma and auspicious action, employing the mirror metaphor to examine one's own
  nature and dharmic conduct. The verses invoke the destruction of inauspiciousness
  and the attainment of longevity and health through righteous self-reflection and
  the realisation of one's true aspirations.
preamble: This work belongs to the tradition of Telugu devotional and philosophical
  poetry, drawing upon Vedic principles of karma and dharma while employing horoscopic
  (horā) frameworks common to Hindu astrological practice. The composition reflects
  the classical Telugu literary convention of embedding moral and spiritual instruction
  within metrical verse, situating daily human action within a cosmological order
  governed by planetary influences and ethical consequence. The invocation of self-examination
  through the mirror (darpana) image recalls Upaniṣadic introspective philosophy,
  while the emphasis on auspiciousness (abhīṣṭa), health (ārogya), and karmic rectification
  connects the work to broader Hindu ethical and wellness traditions.
