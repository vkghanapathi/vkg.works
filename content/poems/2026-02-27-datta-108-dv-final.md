status: draft
abstract: Sri Datta Śatakam is a devotional hymnic composition of one hundred verses
  (śatakam) in Sanskrit dedicated to Dattātreya, the unified form of the Hindu trinity
  (Brahmā, Viṣṇu, Śiva). Composed by Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī and reissued on
  the occasion of Dattātreya Jayantī in 2011, this work systematically expounds the
  philosophical and theological attributes of Dattātreya as the supreme guru and embodiment
  of non-dual Brahman, addressing his incarnational purpose, nomenclature, transcendent
  nature, and role as world-teacher.
preamble: This work belongs to the Sanskrit devotional and philosophical tradition
  of Advaita Vedānta, specifically within the Dattātreya sampradāya (lineage). Dattātreya,
  venerated as an avatāra and the embodiment of the spiritual master (guru) principle,
  occupies a central place in Hindu tantric and yogic traditions. The composition
  draws upon Vedic references, Upaniṣadic philosophy, and the devotional idiom to
  articulate Dattātreya's significance as a liberating principle and universal teacher.
  The text is framed within a guru-disciple relationship, dedicating the work to the
  author's spiritual preceptor, Śrī Gaṇapati Saccidānanda Svāmī, and invoking his
  blessings for the successful articulation of Dattātreya's glory.
