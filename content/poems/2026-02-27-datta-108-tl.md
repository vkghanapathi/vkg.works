abstract: Śrī Datta Śatakam (The Hundred Verses on Dattātreya) is a devotional Sanskrit
  composition by Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī dedicated to Lord Dattātreya, composed
  during the Vikṛti samvat year on the occasion of Devī Śaradnavaratri and Dattātreya
  Jayantī (13 October 2010). The work comprises one hundred verses of praise structured
  thematically around the avatāra (descent), birth narrative, epithets, supremacy,
  the Vedic association, trinitarian attributes, six marks of liberation, the yoga
  of non-attachment, and the advaitic principle of the divine guru Dattātreya as Brahman
  (Saccidānanda).
preamble: This work belongs to the Advaita Vedānta devotional tradition centered on
  Dattātreya, the guru-deity recognized in Hindu philosophy as the incarnation of
  the Trimūrti (Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva united). Dattātreya occupies a central place
  in tantric, yogic, and renunciate (avadhūta) traditions, and is venerated as the
  supreme teacher of non-dual wisdom. Composed in the classical Sanskrit meter-verse
  (ślokabandhana) tradition, this śataka follows the established practice of one-hundred-verse
  homologies dedicated to deities and gurus. The work invokes the blessings of Ganapatī
  Saccidānanda Swami and frames itself as an offering during a major festival calendar
  event.
