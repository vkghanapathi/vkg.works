status: draft
abstract: Śrī Datta Śatakam is a devotional hymnic composition of one hundred stanzas
  (śataka) celebrating the incarnate form and salvific grace of Dattātreya, the Vedic
  teacher-deity of Advaita Vedānta tradition. Each verse employs the classical refrain
  'tat brahmaṇyaṁ bhajēhaṁ mama hṛdi sadayaṁ saccidānanda dattam' and systematically
  unfolds theological themes including Dattātreya's divine descent, namesake glories,
  association with Vedic knowledge, metaphysical attributes, and role as universal
  guru across multiple cosmic ages.
preamble: This work belongs to the sampradāya (doctrinal lineage) of Advaita Vedānta,
  specifically the Dattātreya tradition which venerates the trinitarian embodiment
  of Brahmā, Viṣṇu, and Maheśvara as the supreme nondual Self (Brahman). Dattātreya
  is revered as a paramaguru (supreme preceptor) and incarnate guide to liberation,
  whose historical manifestation (traditionally dated to the Kharṇ era) is commemorated
  annually. The stotram format (invocatory verse) employs Sanskrit's sophisticated
  metrical and philosophical vocabulary to render metaphysical doctrine accessible
  through devotional meditation, a characteristic pedagogy of Vedāntic compositions
  addressed to sincere disciples.
