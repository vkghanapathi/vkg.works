abstract: A Telugu philosophical poem expounding the metaphysical doctrine of creation
  (sṛṣṭi) and the necessity of the Sadguru (Perfect Master) avatar to liberate bound
  souls. The work traces the logical progression from primordial dissolution (pralaya)
  through emanation of creation by Brahmā, the complications arising from embodied
  existence and bondage, and the ultimate intervention of the Trimūrti (Brahma, Visnu,
  Siva) in the form of Dattātreya, the archetypal Sadguru, as the sole means of human
  liberation through wisdom.
preamble: This composition belongs to the Sanskrit-influenced Telugu devotional and
  philosophical poetry tradition, drawing upon Vedantic metaphysics and Purāṇic cosmology.
  It synthesizes classical Hindu metaphysical concepts—particularly the cyclic theology
  of creation and dissolution found in the Brahma Purāṇa and Bhāgavata Purāṇa—with
  the Advaitic doctrine of liberation (mokṣa) through enlightened guidance. The text
  privileges the Dattātreya tradition, a non-dualistic framework emphasizing the Sadguru
  as the embodiment of ultimate truth, integrating themes of karma, māyā (cosmic illusion),
  and the necessity of divine incarnation to restore dharmic order and facilitate
  universal redemption.
