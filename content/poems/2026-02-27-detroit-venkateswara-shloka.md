status: draft
abstract: A devotional verse in Telugu and Sanskrit composed by Dr. Vamshi Krishna
  Ghanapāṭhī celebrating the establishment of a Sri Venkateswara temple in Detroit,
  North America. The work exemplifies the diaspora transmission of Vedic-Puranic devotional
  culture, employing classical metres and theological language to consecrate sacred
  geography in a modern urban context.
preamble: This composition belongs to the stotram (hymn of praise) tradition within
  Vaishnava devotionalism, specifically venerating Venkateswara (Tirupati Balaji),
  one of the most widely worshipped forms of Vishnu in Hindu practice. The work draws
  on Sanskrit and Telugu poetic conventions to establish ritual and theological significance
  for a contemporary temple installation outside India. It reflects the phenomenon
  of Hindu diasporic communities reconstructing sacred spaces and maintaining Vedic-Puranic
  religious practice in North America through vernacular and classical language registers.
