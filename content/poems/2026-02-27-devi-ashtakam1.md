abstract: A devotional hymn in praise of the Goddess (Devī) composed in mātrāchanda
  (syllabic metre) and presented in both Sanskrit and Telugu. The eight verses employ
  sophisticated sound patterning and alliterative techniques while invoking the divine
  feminine in her multiple forms, culminating in a colophon that frames the work as
  a meditation on the Goddess as the omnipresent, luminous principle of consciousness
  (sat-chit-ānanda). The composition demonstrates mastery of classical poetic conventions
  and Tantric theological resonances.
preamble: This work belongs to the Sanskrit stotram (hymn) tradition, specifically
  the genre of devī-stuti (goddess praise) that flourished within Śākta theology and
  ritual practice. The Durgā rāga designation and trisra-gati (triple-time) musical
  notation indicate its intended performance context within classical Vedic or devotional
  music traditions. The invocation of the Goddess in her cosmic and salvific aspects—as
  creatrix, protector, and embodiment of pure consciousness—situates the work within
  the broader Śākta philosophical framework that recognizes the divine feminine as
  the dynamic power (śakti) underlying manifest reality. The bilingual presentation
  in Sanskrit and Telugu reflects the pan-Indian reach of goddess worship and the
  cultural synthesis characteristic of South Indian religious scholarship.
