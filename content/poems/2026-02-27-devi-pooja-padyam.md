abstract: Ṣoḍaśa Dīpaḥ (The Sixteen Lamps) is a devotional poem cycle composed by
  Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī that celebrates the divine feminine principle through
  luminous imagery. The work presents a series of meditative verses invoking Umā/Devī
  through sixteen different lamp visualizations, each associated with celestial bodies
  and sacred mantric powers, establishing a systematic correlation between ritual
  illumination and goddess veneration.
preamble: This composition belongs to the Sanskrit devotional poetry tradition (bhakti
  kāvya) centered on Śaiva and Śākta theology, specifically the worship of Devī in
  her aspect as Umā, the gracious mother goddess. The sixteen lamps (ṣoḍaśa dīpa)
  framework draws from tantric and Purāṇic ritual practices where ritual lamps serve
  as vehicles for divine manifestation and consciousness. The naksatra dīpa (stellar
  lamps) section invokes the twenty-seven lunar mansions as luminous conduits for
  goddess worship, a practice rooted in Vedic astronomy and Hindu astrological ritualism.
  This work exemplifies the scholarly devotional compositions of contemporary Sanskrit
  practitioners who synthesize classical metrical forms with systematic theological
  visualization.
