abstract: A devotional hymn of four stanzas composed in Sanskrit with a parallel Telugu
  rendering, addressing the Divine Mother (Bhagavatī) and invoking her grace through
  the sacred syllable Hrīṃ. The poem synthesizes Tantric philosophy with Advaitic
  non-dualism, presenting the goddess as the embodiment of cosmic compassion, wisdom,
  and the three guṇas, while guiding the aspirant toward realization of Brahman through
  mantra repetition and contemplative practice.
preamble: This work belongs to the Śakta devotional tradition, which venerates the
  Divine Feminine as the supreme principle of creation and consciousness. Rooted in
  Tantric and Vedantic teachings, it invokes the goddess in her multifaceted forms—as
  Kālī, Lakṣmī, and the universal Mother—employing the Hrīṃ bīja (seed mantra) as
  a gateway to metaphysical realization. The parallel Sanskrit and Telugu composition
  reflects the pan-Indian character of Hindu philosophical discourse and suggests
  the work's function within scholarly and devotional circles across linguistic regions.
