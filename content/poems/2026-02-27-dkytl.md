abstract: A didactic poem on Datta Kriyā Yoga, a tantric-yogic discipline attributed
  to the teachings of Śrī Saccidānanda Guru. The work systematises finger-counting
  methods (aṅguli gaṇana yoga) within a five-element (pañcabhūta) framework, mapping
  the five fingers to cosmic principles (earth, water, fire, air, ether) and providing
  detailed numerical sequences for yogic practice and realisation.
preamble: This work belongs to the Datta Kriyā Yoga tradition, a lineage of tantric-yogic
  practice centred on the Avadhūta deity Dattātreya and transmitted through the Saccidānanda
  paramparā (guru succession). The opening verse (maṅgalāśāsana) invokes the auspiciousness
  of this yoga as a supreme means of realisation endorsed by accomplished yogins.
  The systematic enumeration of finger positions and their correlation with the five
  elements reflects a broader tantric epistemology wherein the microcosm of the body
  encodes macrocosmic truth. This pedagogical structure—combining philosophy, anatomy,
  and numerical methodology—is characteristic of Dattatreya-centred tantric compositions
  in Sanskrit and Telugu literature.
