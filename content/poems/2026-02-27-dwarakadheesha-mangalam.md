abstract: A collection of devotional poems composed in Telugu by Dr. Vamshi Krishna
  Ghanapāṭhī, demonstrating the integration of classical Vedic learning with vernacular
  poetic expression. These verses exemplify the living tradition of ghanapāṭha (Vedic
  chanting practice) channelled through lyrical devotion.
preamble: This work emerges from the Vedic recitation tradition (ghanapāṭha), which
  emphasises precise memorisation and rhythmic articulation of Vedic mantras. Dr.
  Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī, a contemporary scholar-practitioner of this ancient discipline,
  has extended the ghanapāṭha method into Telugu poetic composition, bridging Sanskrit
  liturgical knowledge with regional literary expression. The poems reflect both the
  technical precision of Vedic study and the devotional sentiment characteristic of
  bhakti traditions in South India.
