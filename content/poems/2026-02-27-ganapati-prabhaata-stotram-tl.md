abstract: సమారమ్భः (Samāramhbhaḥ) is a Sanskrit devotional poem cycle comprising sixteen
  thematic hymns addressed to Ganesha, structured as progressive invocations and meditations
  on the deity's cosmological and soteriological functions. The work exemplifies the
  Vedantic-Tantric synthesis characteristic of classical Telugu and Sanskrit philosophical
  devotionalism, drawing on Upanishadic doctrine (particularly the Atharvashīrṣa),
  Puranic authority (Mudgala Purāṇa), and the metaphysical frameworks of Kashmir Shaivism
  and Advaita Vedanta.
preamble: This work belongs to the Sanskrit stotram and stotra-paddhati tradition
  of Hindu devotional literature, specifically within the theological framework that
  understands Ganesha (Gaṇeśa, Heramba) not merely as a remover of obstacles but as
  a metaphysical principle encompassing cosmic creation, sustenance, and dissolution.
  The sixteen poems progress from initial invocation and parental vision through doctrinal
  assertions grounded in classical Vedic texts (Atharvaveda-Śīrṣa, Mudgala Purāṇa),
  ritual practice (mantra-meditation and japa-sādhana), and non-dual philosophical
  realisation. The consistent refrain—'Gaṇeśa tvaṁ kalye nṛṣu vitara chintāmaṇi śubham'—anchors
  the soteriological vision in a request for the bestowal of the philosopher's stone
  (cintāmaṇi) of auspicious knowledge among human seekers.
