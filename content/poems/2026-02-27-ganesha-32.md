abstract: A devotional hymn celebrating the thirty-two forms of Gaṇeśa, the Hindu
  deity of obstacles and beginnings. Each stanza enumerates divine epithets and manifestations
  of Gaṇeśa while reinforcing a refrain affirming that the thirty-two-form Lord Gaṇeśa
  bestows auspiciousness. The work exemplifies the liturgical enumeration of divine
  forms common in tantric and devotional Sanskrit hymnography.
preamble: This poem belongs to the Gaṇeśa-devotion tradition within Hindu religious
  practice, specifically the enumeration and worship of divine forms (rūpa) as a mode
  of ritual propitiation. Gaṇeśa, the elephant-headed deity venerated at the threshold
  of all rites and undertakings, is here presented through his thirty-two distinct
  manifestations—each bearing specific epithets, associations, and powers (Siddhi,
  Vijaya, Hāridrā, etc.). The anaphoric structure and rhythmic repetition reflect
  the oral recitation practices (ghanapāṭha) embedded in Vedic and post-Vedic liturgy,
  making this work suitable for ritual chanting and meditation.
