status: draft
abstract: A ritual sankalpa (vow/intention) and devotional hymn sequence dedicated
  to cow veneration (go seva) as an offering to Parameśvara. The text comprises a
  structured vow formula naming the ritualist and their intention, followed by eight
  Sanskrit verses praising the cow (Kamadhenu) as cosmic mother and sustainer, each
  verse functioning as a petition for blessings in exchange for faithful cow service.
preamble: This work belongs to the Hindu devotional and ritualistic tradition of cow
  veneration, rooted in Vedic cosmology where the cow occupies a position of sacred
  importance. The sankalpa (formal declaration of ritual intent) is a foundational
  element of Vedic and post-Vedic ritual practice, establishing the ritualist's identity,
  occasion, and spiritual objective before performing worship. The eight stanzas that
  follow invoke the cow through multiple scriptural and mythological epithets (Kamadhenu,
  the wish-fulfilling cow; mother of the Vasus; sister of the Adityas), drawing on
  imagery from the Puranas and Vedic hymns. This text integrates classical Sanskrit
  poetic meter with ritual formula, exemplifying the synthesis of liturgical precision
  and devotional expression characteristic of Hindu household and votive practices.
