abstract: Govinda Laharī is a devotional lyric poem in Sanskrit composed by Dr. Vamshi
  Krishna celebrating the splendor and transcendent nature of Lord Viṣṇu (Govinda),
  structured as a series of interconnected stanzas in the Śikhariṇī meter. The work
  combines Vedantic philosophy with devotional sentiment, addressing themes of divine
  grace, the supremacy of Govinda, and the path of complete self-surrender to the
  deity enshrined at Śrīvenkateśvara (Tirupati).
preamble: This work belongs to the tradition of Sanskrit devotional poetry (bhakti-kāvya)
  addressed to Viṣṇu in his manifestation as Śrīnivāsa at the sacred shrine of Venkaṭa
  (Tirupati/Tirumala) in South India. The composition was undertaken in the month
  of Māgha during the author's residence at the temple during the Navrātra festival,
  under the spiritual guidance of Śrī Gaṇapati Saccidānanda Svāmin. The work exemplifies
  the Sanskrit poetic tradition of eulogizing divine attributes through carefully
  composed meters, integrating philosophical meditation on non-duality (advaita) with
  expressions of personal devotion and theological reflection on divine majesty.
