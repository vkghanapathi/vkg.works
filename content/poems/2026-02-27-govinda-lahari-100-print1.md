abstract: Govinda Laharī is a devotional lyric poem composed by Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī,
  structured in the śikhariṇī metre and dedicated to Lord Viṣṇu (Govinda). The work
  comprises devotional verses celebrating divine attributes, cosmic functions, and
  philosophical concepts of non-duality, arranged thematically around epithets and
  manifestations of the supreme deity. Composed during the author's tenure as an examiner
  of Vedic studies at Tirupati, the work presents a synthesis of bhakti sentiment
  with Vedantic philosophy.
preamble: This work belongs to the śrīvaiṣṇava devotional tradition, a major Vedantic
  school venerating Lord Viṣṇu as the supreme Brahman. The composition situates itself
  within the exegetical and devotional culture of Tirupati (Śrīvēṅkaṭāchal), one of
  South India's foremost pilgrimage centres. The text draws on classical Sanskrit
  poetic conventions while employing recurring refrains (particularly the refrain
  'svvasiddhāṁ Govindo dvayrahita saṁsthāṁ pradishatām') to reinforce theological
  assertions regarding Viṣṇu's transcendent nature, salvific function, and manifestation
  in the cosmos. The work was composed under the spiritual guidance of Śrī Gaṇapati
  Saccidānanda Svāmi and addresses the glory (vaikunta) of the Lord through structured
  meditation and praise.
