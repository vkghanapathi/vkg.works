abstract: Govinda Laharī is a devotional lyric poem in Sanskrit composed by Vamshi
  Krishna Ghanapāṭhī in the śikhariṇī meter, celebrating the divine attributes and
  cosmic significance of Lord Vishnu (Govinda). The work comprises philosophical and
  devotional verses structured around traditional themes of Vaishnava theology, each
  stanza concluding with the refrain "svasiddhāṁ govindo dvayrahita saṁsthāṁ pradishtatām"
  (may Govinda, established in non-duality, reveal his own perfection). Composed during
  the author's tenure as an examiner of Vedic students at Tirupati, the work represents
  a synthesis of classical Sanskrit poetic craft with contemporary devotional expression
  within the Śrī Vaishnava tradition.
preamble: This work emerges from the Śrī Vaishnava theological and devotional tradition
  centered on the worship of Vishnu (Govinda) as the supreme reality. The preamble
  situates the composition at Tirupati (Śrī Venkaṭāchala), the principal pilgrimage
  site of this sampradāya, and credits the spiritual guidance of the author's guru,
  Gaṇapati Saccidānanda Svāmī. The verses engage classical themes from Vedānta philosophy—particularly
  the non-dual nature of Brahman, divine compassion (kṛpā), and the accessibility
  of mokṣa through devotion—while employing the ornamental, melodic conventions of
  Sanskrit kāvya to render theological doctrine as lyric meditation.
