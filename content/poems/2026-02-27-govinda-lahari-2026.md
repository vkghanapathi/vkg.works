abstract: Govinda Laharī is a devotional lyric poem composed by Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī
  in the Śikhariṇī metre, celebrating the divine glory and attributes of Lord Viṣṇu
  (Govinda) through a series of interconnected verses. The work was composed in Mārgaśīrṣa
  month during the author's tenure as an examiner of Vedic scholars at the Venkateśvara
  temple on Tirumala hill, under the spiritual guidance of his guru Gaṇapati Saccidānanda
  Swami, and structured as a unified meditation on the deity's non-dual, self-sufficient
  nature.
preamble: Govinda Laharī belongs to the devotional poetic tradition of Vaiṣṇavism,
  specifically the theology and praxis of Śrī Vaiṣṇavism centred on the Venkateśvara
  (Tirupati) temple complex. The work exemplifies the Sanskrit poetic hymn (prabandha)
  as a vehicle for theological exposition, employing the classical Śikhariṇī metre
  and the refrain structure typical of devotional lyric poetry. Each verse addresses
  distinct theological and devotional themes—from the incomprehensibility of the divine
  to the efficacy of surrender—while maintaining formal metrical and thematic unity,
  anchoring them in the salvific principle of God's dual-less (dvaya-rahita) existence.
