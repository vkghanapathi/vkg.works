abstract: A devotional and protective composition attributed to Yājñavalkya that presents
  the Gāyatrī Kavaca (Armour of Gāyatrī), a mantra-based protective formula mapping
  the syllables of the sacred Gāyatrī mantra to different parts and directions of
  the body, followed by an eight-verse hymn of praise to Gāyatrī (Gāyatrī Aṣṭakam).
  The work exemplifies the Tantric integration of Vedic mantra with body-centred ritual
  protection and feminine divine worship.
preamble: This composition stands within the Vedic devotional and Tantric traditions,
  drawing on the Gāyatrī mantra—the most revered mantra of the Rigveda and central
  to Vedic ritual and meditation practices. The Kavaca (protective armour) genre appears
  throughout Hindu ritual literature as a method of invoking divine protection through
  the sacred geometry and syllabic power (śakti) of mantras. The attribution to Yājñavalkya,
  the celebrated Vedic sage and author of the Yājñavalkya Smṛti, lends scriptural
  authority. The accompanying Aṣṭakam embeds Gāyatrī within the broader feminine divine
  principle (Śakti), addressing her through multiple goddess forms—Sāvitrī, Sarasvatī,
  Vaiṣṇavī—reflecting post-Vedic theological developments that identify the abstract
  mantra with personal, accessible forms of the Goddess.
