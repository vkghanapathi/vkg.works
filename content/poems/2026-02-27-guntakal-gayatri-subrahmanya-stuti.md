abstract: A devotional prayer composition in Telugu and Sanskrit honouring Subrahmanya
  (Murugan/Skanda), the six-faced son of Śiva, followed by an invocational hymn to
  Gāyatrī Devī. The work combines personal petitionary prayers with recitation of
  the foundational Vedic mantra, exemplifying the integration of sectarian devotion
  within Vedic ritualism.
preamble: This composition belongs to the Śaiva devotional tradition, specifically
  the Kārttikeya or Skanda worship lineage. Subrahmanya, venerated as the commander
  of the divine forces and remover of obstacles, occupies a central place in South
  Indian Hindu practice. The appended Gāyatrī Prayer invokes the Mother of the Vedas
  herself, the eight-syllable mantra (Oṁ bhūr bhuvaḥ svaḥ) that serves as the foundational
  utterance of Vedic religion. By positioning these prayers together, Dr. Vamshi Krishna
  integrates specific deity devotion within the overarching framework of Vedic cosmic
  order and sacred sound.
