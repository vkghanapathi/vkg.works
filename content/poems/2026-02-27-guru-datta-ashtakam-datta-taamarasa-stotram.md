abstract: The Gurudattāṣṭakam is an eight-stanza devotional hymn composed in the tāmarasavṛtti
  metre, addressed to a guru-deity identified with Hari-Hara (Viṣṇu-Śiva) and characterised
  as the bestower of spiritual grace and liberation. Each verse praises the guru's
  attributes—cosmic form, mastery over desire, destruction of suffering, purification
  of sin, preservation of dharma, and capacity to grant mokṣa—culminating in a closing
  invocation that the guru's nectar-like essence (tāmarasa) may blossom the devotee's
  heart-lotus. The work exemplifies Sanskrit bhakti poetry and the guru-centric devotional
  theology prevalent in medieval Hindu philosophical schools.
preamble: This hymn belongs to the Sanskrit devotional and philosophical tradition
  of guru-worship (gurupūjā), a practice that gained prominence across multiple Hindu
  lineages from the medieval period onward. The tāmarasavṛtti is a classical metres
  associated with lyrical compositions in Sanskrit religious literature. The guru
  is here envisioned not merely as a human teacher but as a divine principle embodying
  both Viṣṇu and Śiva, the dual aspects of cosmic preservation and transcendence.
  The rhetoric of spiritual grace (prasāda), removal of karmic obstruction, and the
  metaphor of the heart-lotus are characteristic of Vedāntic and tantric devotional
  frameworks, positioning the guru as the primary instrument of liberation (mokṣa).
  This work thus sits within the broader Hindu philosophical and devotional synthesis
  of late classical and early medieval Sanskrit composition.
