abstract: Guru Saptakam is a seven-stanza devotional hymn in Sanskrit composed by
  Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī that venerates Gaṇapati Guru, identified as the embodiment
  of Saccidānanda (Existence-Consciousness-Bliss), and celebrates his role as a spiritual
  preceptor and upholder of Vedic wisdom. The work follows the traditional stotra
  (hymn) form with a phalaśruti (benediction) and employs elaborate metaphorical language
  to praise the guru's multifaceted spiritual accomplishments, including mastery of
  Vedic learning, yogic practice, music, and the Dattāpīṭha lineage. The hymn represents
  a contemporary composition in the classical laudatory tradition, preserving both
  Sanskrit and regional (Telugu and Kannada) orthographic forms of the same text.
preamble: This work belongs to the guru-bhakti (devotion to the spiritual teacher)
  tradition within Vedic and tantric Hindu practice, wherein the guru is revered as
  a manifest embodiment of divine consciousness and wisdom. The composition honors
  a specific guru within the Dattāpīṭha sampradāya, a significant monastic lineage
  that traces its teaching authority back to the sage Dattatreya and emphasizes synthesis
  of Vedantic knowledge, yogic discipline, and devotional service. Such stotra compositions
  are integral to this tradition, functioning as both devotional practice and doctrinal
  affirmation, typically recited by disciples and scholars to invoke the guru's grace
  and recall his spiritual accomplishments.
