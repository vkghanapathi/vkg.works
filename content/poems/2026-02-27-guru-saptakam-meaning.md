status: draft
abstract: A devotional poem sequence in Sanskrit composed by Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī,
  offering reverential praise to Sri Ganapati Sachchidananda Swamiji, the author's
  spiritual preceptor. The work combines biographical narrative with philosophical
  exposition, celebrating the Guru's lineage (Bharadvāja Gotra), spiritual accomplishments,
  and establishment of Dattatreya institutions worldwide, while articulating core
  doctrines of Advaita Vedānta and guru-bhakti within a structured verse framework.
preamble: This work participates in the Hindu devotional and philosophical tradition
  of guru-bhakti (devotion to the spiritual preceptor), situated within Advaita Vedāntic
  thought and the Dattatreya sampradāya (spiritual lineage). The composition follows
  classical Sanskrit kāvya conventions while functioning as biographical hagiography
  and philosophical instruction, addressing an educated readership familiar with Vedic
  learning, monastic (Avadhūta) renunciate traditions, and the role of the Guru as
  liberator. The work invokes classical motifs of lineage (Gotra and Pravara), scriptural
  authority, yogic powers (Siddhis), and the establishment of sacred institutional
  spaces (Pīṭhas) as markers of spiritual authenticity and social dharmic engagement.
