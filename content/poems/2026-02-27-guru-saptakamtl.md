abstract: Guru Saptakam is a devotional hymn of seven stanzas in Sanskrit and Telugu
  composed by Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī, celebrating Sri Ganapati Guru (Dattātreya)
  as the supreme preceptor embodying Sat-Chit-Ananda (Being-Consciousness-Bliss).
  The work praises the guru's mastery of Vedic knowledge, yoga practice, music theory,
  and spiritual liberation, culminating in a phala-śruti (blessing verse) that promises
  spiritual attainment to those who recollect the guru's divine glory and character.
preamble: This work belongs to the guru-bhakti (devotion to the spiritual master)
  tradition within Hindu philosophy and practice, particularly resonant with Advaita
  Vedanta and tantric spirituality. The seven-fold hymnic structure mirrors classical
  Sanskrit stotras dedicated to divine or semi-divine masters. Sri Dattātreya, the
  recipient of praise here, is venerated across Hindu, Buddhist, and yogic traditions
  as the embodiment of the Trimurti and the universal guru. The composition integrates
  Vedic scholarship, yogic discipline, musical knowledge (music being a pathway to
  brahman), and merciful service to humanity—presenting the ideal guru as a multidimensional
  liberator of all beings.
