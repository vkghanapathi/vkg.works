abstract: Guru Siddhi Stotram is a devotional hymn celebrating the eight supernatural
  perfections (ashta-siddhis) embodied in the spiritual preceptor. Organized as a
  series of prayers addressing each siddhi—starting with Garima (weightiness/majesty),
  Mahima (greatness), and Anima (minuteness)—the work combines Vedantic philosophy
  with devotional rhetoric, interpreting the guru's transformative power through the
  lens of classical scriptural commentary (vyākhyā) traditions and employing detailed
  etymological analysis of Sanskrit terms.
preamble: This work belongs to the Hindu guru-yoga tradition, wherein the preceptor
  is venerated as the embodiment of divine knowledge and liberating grace. Rooted
  in the Upanishadic understanding of the guru-disciple relationship and elaborated
  through later Advaita and bhakti schools, the Guru Siddhi Stotram applies the metaphysical
  framework of the eight yogic perfections—traditionally associated with divine or
  ascetic attainment—to the spiritual authority of the sadguru (true teacher). The
  composition uses systematic Sanskrit exegesis to unfold both the philosophical meaning
  and the transformative function of each siddhi, presenting the guru as the gateway
  to sat-chit-ananda (being-consciousness-bliss).
