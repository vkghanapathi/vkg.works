abstract: A devotional stotra (hymn of praise) to Hanuman composed by Dr. Vamshi Krishna
  Ghanapāṭhī, structured as eight verses of salutation followed by a phalaśruti (statement
  of benefits) and a closing invocation. The work emphasizes Hanuman's protection
  of the devotee through the metaphor of the single-eyed glance (ekanetre-kaṭākṣeṇa),
  presenting him as cosmic protector, dharma-guardian, and compassionate ally of the
  afflicted.
preamble: This stotra belongs to the Sanskrit devotional literature tradition centered
  on Hanuman, the monkey deity revered throughout Hindu practice as the supreme devotee
  of Rama and embodiment of courage, loyalty, and dharmic duty. Composed in both Sanskrit
  and Telugu, the work engages classical Vedic hymnic conventions—particularly the
  repetition of a refrain and the concluding phalaśruti—while addressing contemporary
  spiritual needs including protection from supernatural afflictions, economic hardship,
  and existential fear. The author, a scholar-practitioner of Vedic recitation (ghanapāṭha),
  situates the hymn within the living tradition of devotional worship and mantra practice.
