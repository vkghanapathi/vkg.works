abstract: A benedictory verse (maṅgalāśāsana) composed by Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī
  for the sacred thread ceremony (upanayana) of a Brahmin youth named Chaitanya Sharma,
  son of Nāgabhūṣaṇa Śāstri of the Vādhūla gotra. The work praises the father's role
  in initiating his son into Vedic study and dharmic practice, invoking the protection
  and blessings of Savitṛ through the Gāyatrī mantra.
preamble: This work belongs to the tradition of ceremonial blessings (maṅgalāśāsana)
  that accompany the upanayana saṃskāra, a foundational life-stage ritual in Vedic
  Brahminism. The upanayana marks a youth's formal initiation into Vedic learning
  and his assumption of brahminical duties under a preceptor. Composed on 20 June
  2011, this verse celebrates the ritual performed by Nāgabhūṣaṇa Śāstri, a scholar
  of the Vādhūla Vedic school, linking the initiate's entry into Vedic knowledge with
  the meditative cultivation of brahma-ātman consciousness and ethical conduct (dharma-mārga).
  The work reflects the south Indian Smārta Brahminical practice of composing auspicious
  verses in Sanskrit and Telugu to sanctify major life transitions.
