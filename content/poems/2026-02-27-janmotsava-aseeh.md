abstract: A Sanskrit benedictory poem (śubhāśaṃsana) composed on the thirty-fourth
  birth anniversary of the subject, invoking auspicious blessings through the register
  of Vedic ritual and philosophical devotion. The work employs the classical Sanskrit
  metric and panegyric convention to consecrate a milestone in the life of a revered
  scholar, with parallel composition in Kannada script affirming the text's cross-linguistic
  authority within the South Indian scholarly tradition.
preamble: This work belongs to the śubhāśaṃsana tradition—a form of auspicious benediction
  in Sanskrit poetry used to mark significant life milestones and invoke divine favour.
  Rooted in Vedic ritual idiom and Advaitic philosophical vocabulary, such compositions
  typically invoke the blessings of Brahman (ultimate reality) and aspire toward spiritual
  stability (brahmi sthiti) for the subject. The dated composition (12 January 2011,
  corresponding to Vikṛti year, Puṣya month, śukla aṣṭamī) reflects the South Indian
  scholarly practice of recording works according to both Gregorian and traditional
  Hindu calendars, while the parallel Kannada script attestation demonstrates the
  multilingual reach of learned Sanskrit composition in modern Indic scholarly circles.
