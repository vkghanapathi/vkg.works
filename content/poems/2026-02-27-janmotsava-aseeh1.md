abstract: A Sanskrit verse composition celebrating the thirty-fourth birth anniversary
  of an honoured individual, composed in the classical stotram (laudatory hymn) tradition.
  The poem invokes blessings from celestial beings and philosophical principles, requesting
  the bestowal of complete brahminical fulfilment and steadfast wisdom upon the recipient.
  Dated to 12 January 2011 (Vikṛti saṃvatsara, Puṣya śuklāṣṭamī), the work exemplifies
  the living practice of composing auspicious Sanskrit verses for celebratory occasions.
preamble: This work belongs to the Hindu tradition of janmotsava śubhāśaṃsana (auspicious
  blessings for birth anniversaries), a genre that combines Vedic ritual sensibilities
  with classical Sanskrit poetics. The composer draws upon the theological framework
  of Advaita Vedānta philosophy, invoking concepts of cit-ātman (consciousness as
  self) and brahminical completeness (brahmi sthiti). The inclusion of Kannada script
  alongside Sanskrit reflects the multilingual scholarly culture of South Indian Vedic
  learning, while the precise astronomical date (tithi) grounds the composition within
  traditional Hindu calendar systems and ritual punctuality.
