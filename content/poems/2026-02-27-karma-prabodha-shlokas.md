status: draft
abstract: Karmaprabodha Granthavishayah is a didactic poem on the hidden principles
  (tattva) of Vedic ritual practice, particularly the relationship between ritual
  performance (karma) and ultimate spiritual attainment. The work proposes that the
  profound truths embedded in Vedic and Smarta rituals can be comprehended through
  systematic engagement with ritual action, which ultimately transcends itself to
  lead the practitioner toward higher spiritual realization.
preamble: This work belongs to the exegetical tradition of Vedic ritual philosophy,
  drawing on both Srautasutras (elaborations of Vedic sacrifice) and Smartasutras
  (domestic ritual protocols). It addresses practitioners of Vedic religion seeking
  to understand the soteriological dimension of ritual practice. The text assumes
  familiarity with Vedic hermeneutics and the classical framework wherein external
  ritual action (prarabdha karma) serves as a gateway to knowledge of Brahman, as
  articulated in Upanisadic and Vedantic traditions. The composition appears to follow
  an instructional format common to Sanskrit philosophical poetry, moving from invocation
  through graduated exposition of ritual principles to metaphysical conclusions.
