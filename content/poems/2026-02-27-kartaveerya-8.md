abstract: An eight-verse devotional hymn (aṣṭaka) addressed to Kārtavīrya Arjuna,
  the legendary Haihaya king and an avatāra of Viṣṇu, petitioning him for the recovery
  of lost wealth and possessions. Composed in Sanskrit with a Telugu recension, the
  work exemplifies the bhakti tradition's approach to personal propitiation through
  structured, repetitive devotional recitation, culminating in an instruction that
  the hymn be chanted eight times with devotion and fidelity to Datta mantra practice.
preamble: This work belongs to the Datta-centric devotional literature of South Indian
  Hindu tradition, specifically invoking Kārtavīrya Arjuna as a manifestation of the
  deity Dattātreya. Within the broader Vaiṣṇava and Shaiva synthesis characteristic
  of medieval and early modern Deccan spirituality, Kārtavīrya Arjuna represents divine
  sovereignty over material welfare and the restoration of dharma. The hymn's petitional
  structure—wherein the devotee addresses the deity by multiple names and epithets—reflects
  established Sanskrit liturgical conventions found in Purāṇic devotional hymns. The
  inclusion of a Telugu recension indicates the text's intended circulation among
  Telugu-speaking bhaktas and its role within a multilingual devotional ecosystem.
