abstract: Kāryasiddhi Añjaneyāṣṭakam is an eight-verse devotional hymn dedicated to
  Hanumān, composed in Telugu by Dr. Vamshi Krishna. The work invokes the deity through
  eight distinct epithets and qualities, with each stanza concluding in an identical
  refrain requesting success in all endeavors (kāryasiddhi). The text culminates in
  a phalaśruti (statement of fruit) affirming that recitation of the octave accompanied
  by coconut offering ensures the fulfillment of one's undertakings.
preamble: This work belongs to the Hanumān devotion tradition within Hindu religious
  practice, specifically the genre of aṣṭaka (eight-verse) stotras or hymns of praise.
  Hanumān, the monkey devotee of Rāma in the Rāmāyaṇa epic, occupies a central position
  in Hindu worship as an emblem of unwavering devotion, courage, and the removal of
  obstacles. The aṣṭaka form—a classical poetic structure presenting eight homologous
  verses—has been employed for centuries to render deity-specific propitiation accessible
  and efficacious. This particular composition adapts the traditional aṣṭaka framework
  to Telugu vernacular composition, maintaining ritual integrity while expanding accessibility
  to non-Sanskrit-reading devotees.
