abstract: An eight-verse devotional hymn (aṣṭaka) addressed to Hanumān as the remover
  of obstacles and fulfiller of endeavours. Each stanza invokes a different aspect
  of Hanumān's divine power—from his unlimited wealth and learning to his protection
  against malevolent forces and his embodiment of devotion to Rāma—concluding with
  a phala-śruti (statement of efficacy) promising success in undertakings through
  recitation and the offering of coconut to the deity.
preamble: This work belongs to the devotional literature tradition of North Indian
  Hinduism, specifically the veneration of Hanumān (Añjaneyā), the monkey deity and
  devoted follower of Rāma in the Rāmāyaṇa epic. Hanumān-worship, prevalent throughout
  Hindu practice, emphasises his role as a remover of obstacles, a grant-giver of
  courage and success, and an exemplar of bhakti (devotion). The eight-verse format
  (aṣṭaka) is a traditional poetic structure common in Hindu liturgical and devotional
  compositions. The work functions as both a hymn of praise and a ritual invocation,
  with the accompanying phala-śruti (fruit-statement) and samarpaṇa-mantra (dedication
  formula) indicating its use in personal worship and offerings.
