abstract: This is an eight-verse devotional hymn (aṣṭakam) in Telugu dedicated to
  Hanumān (Anjaneya), the monkey deity venerated in Hindu tradition for his role in
  the Rāmāyaṇa and his powers of accomplishment and protection. Each verse invokes
  Hanumān with different epithets and attributes, closing with a refrain requesting
  the fulfillment of desires through the offering of coconut, and concludes with a
  merit statement (phalaśruti) and dedication mantra affirming the efficacy of recitation
  paired with ritual offering.
preamble: This work belongs to the devotional hymnographic tradition (stotrakāvya)
  of Telugu Hinduism, specifically the genre of short devotional poems designed for
  ritual recitation and spiritual practice. Hanumān worship, particularly through
  eight-verse hymns, is a widespread practice in South Indian Hindu temples and households,
  where the deity is invoked for the successful completion of endeavors (kāryasiddhi),
  protection from malevolent forces, and cultivation of devotion to Rāma. The repeated
  refrain and the concluding phalaśruti reflect the performative and soteriological
  dimensions of devotional composition in the Bhakti tradition, wherein recitation
  combined with material offering (here, coconut/nārikela) is understood to yield
  concrete spiritual and practical benefits.
