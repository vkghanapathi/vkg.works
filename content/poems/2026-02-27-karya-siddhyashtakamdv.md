abstract: Kāryasiddhi Āñjaneyāṣṭakam is an eight-verse devotional hymn composed in
  Telugu that invokes Hanumān for the successful accomplishment of tasks and endeavors.
  Each verse follows a consistent metrical and refrain structure, concluding with
  a benedictory formula requesting the grant of task-completion (kāryasiddhi) through
  the offering of coconut (nārikela). The work includes a phalaśruti (statement of
  benefits) and samarpana mantra (dedication formula) that frame its ritual application.
preamble: This work belongs to the tradition of Hanumān devotion within Hinduism,
  specifically the practice of composing octaves (aṣṭakas) as vehicles for petition
  and praise. Hanumān, the monkey devotee of Rāma venerated across Hindu and Vaiṣṇava
  traditions, is here invoked in his aspect as remover of obstacles and facilitator
  of auspicious outcomes. The hymn draws upon classical Sanskrit poetic conventions
  while composing in Telugu, reflecting the vernacular devotional literature of South
  Indian Vaiṣṇavism. The prescribed ritual offering of coconut and the explicit statement
  of efficacy mark this as a practical liturgical text intended for regular worship
  and recitation.
