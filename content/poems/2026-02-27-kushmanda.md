abstract: A comprehensive liturgical hymn of expiation and purification addressed
  to Agni (the fire deity) and various Vedic deities, in which the speaker seeks absolution
  from transgressions across multiple domains—speech, action, bodily conduct, and
  thought. The text employs repetitive invocations of the gārhapatya fire and celestial
  witnesses (Mitra, Varuṇa, Soma, Indra, Agni, Bṛhaspati) to ritually nullify accumulated
  sin (enas) and restore ritual purity, drawing on mythological exemplars of purification
  such as Trita and Sūrya.
preamble: This work belongs to the Vedic śrauta and prayaścitta (expiation) tradition,
  functioning as a śuddhi-stuti or purificatory prayer within the broader context
  of Vedic ritual practice. The composition invokes the Gārhapatya fire—the household
  fire maintained in the domestic Vedic altar—as the primary purifying agent, alongside
  appeal to the major Vedic deities who serve as cosmic witnesses to sin and virtue.
  The hymn reflects the Vedic-Brahminical understanding of sin as a material or energetic
  substance (enas) that must be discharged through ritual utterance, divine mediation,
  and the transformative power of sacred fire, consistent with protocols found in
  the Atharvavedic and Yajurvedic literature of prayaścitta.
