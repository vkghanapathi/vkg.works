title: अवधूत दत्त पीठाधिपतीनां जगद्गुरूणां

status: draft
abstract: A Sanskrit encomium composed by Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī in honour
  of Shri Kuppa Venkata Krishnamurthy on the occasion of his sixtieth-birthday celebration
  (shashtiyabda-pūrti). The three-verse poem praises Krishnamurthy's mastery of Vedic
  scholarship, particularly his command of the Yajurveda and Chandas (prosody), and
  his role as Vidyādhikārin (superintendent of learning) at the Avdhūta Datta Pīṭha,
  a major monastic seat within the Dattātreya lineage.
preamble: This dedicatory work belongs to the Sanskrit laudatory poetry tradition
  (praśasti-kāvya) associated with Hindu monastic institutions (maṭhas). The Avdhūta
  Datta Pīṭha is a significant spiritual establishment tracing its authority through
  the Paramahaṃsa Datta Vijayānanda Tīrtha, a renunciate order honouring Dattātreya
  as the supreme guru. The poem situates Krishnamurthy within this lineage as a custodian
  of Vedic knowledge and philosophical learning, invoking both eastern and western
  intellectual traditions while anchoring his accomplishments in orthodox Vedic scholarship
  and guru-disciple transmission.
