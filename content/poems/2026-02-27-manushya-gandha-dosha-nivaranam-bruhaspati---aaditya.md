title: मनुष्यगन्धदोष निवारणम्
date: '2026-02-27'
author: Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī
status: draft
abstract: This liturgical composition by Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī draws upon
  Rigvedic and Dharmaśāstra sources to construct a ritual remedy (निवारणम्) for the
  spiritual impurity termed 'human odour' (मनुष्यगन्धदोष). The work assembles Vedic
  hymnic material addressing the solar deities, ancestral forces, and the universalized
  divine presence, arranged as a structured invocatory sequence with prescribed ritual
  intention (संकल्प) for purification and benediction.
preamble: Rooted in the Vedic sacrificial tradition and the normative jurisprudence
  of Dharmaśāstra, this composition belongs to the genre of apotropaic (अपत्रपण) ritual
  texts designed to neutralize cosmically and socially defined defects. The concept
  of मनुष्यगन्धदोष appears in classical Dharma literature (notably the Dharmasindhu)
  as a form of ritual or social contamination requiring expiation. Dr. Ghanapāṭhī's
  work assembles passages from the Rigveda, Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, and Śaunaka Samhitā,
  framing them as a unified invocatory-oblatory (आहुति) sequence directed toward the
  solar deities (आदित्य), the universal divine assembly (विश्वदेव), and the ancestral-cosmic
  principle (पितृ), grounded in the Vedantic principle of correspondence between microcosm
  and macrocosm.
