abstract: A benedictory poem composed by Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī on the occasion
  of the Sri Ganesha Saccidananda Vedapatha School's auspicious functions. The verse
  invokes blessings upon the institution and its patrons, particularly Sri Datta Venkatesha,
  employing classical Sanskrit kavya conventions to articulate prayers for institutional
  prosperity, scholarly advancement, and divine grace.
preamble: This work belongs to the tradition of institutional panegyric poetry in
  classical Sanskrit, composed to commemorate and bless Vedic educational establishments
  in South India. The poem situates itself within the devotional framework of Sri
  Vaishnavism, invoking Venkatesha (Tirupati Balaji) as the ultimate source of grace
  and patronage. The Sri Ganesha Saccidananda Vedapatha School represents the continuation
  of Vedic learning and ritual practice in contemporary religious life, and this benedictory
  verse functions as both spiritual invocation and institutional affirmation, reflecting
  the composer's role as a preserver and promoter of Vedic recitation traditions (ghanapāṭha).
