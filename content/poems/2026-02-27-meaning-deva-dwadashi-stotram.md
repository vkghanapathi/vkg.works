title: దేవ ద్వాదశీ స్తోత్రమ్
date: '2026-02-27'

status: draft
abstract: 'A Telugu devotional hymn to Śiva comprising four sections: an invocation
  (prārthanā) seeking divine mercy, a verse on sacred pilgrimage sites (tīrthasthanam),
  a ritual worship formula (archanam), and verses on Śiva as both destroyer and creator
  (pralayakartā sraṣṭā). Each verse includes detailed word-by-word commentary (pratipādārtha)
  elucidating Sanskrit and Telugu meanings, making it a pedagogical text for advanced
  students of Śaiva devotion and Vedic interpretation.'
preamble: This work belongs to the Śaiva bhakti tradition of South India and demonstrates
  the syncretism of Vedic ritual knowledge with devotional practice. The text invokes
  Śiva (Śaṅkara, Maheśvara, Rudra) through multiple theological dimensions—as the
  benevolent grant of refuge, as the presence animating sacred geography, as the recipient
  of ritual worship, and as the ultimate principle of cosmic dissolution and regeneration.
  The interweaving of Vedic exegesis (particularly citations from Yajurveda and Atharvaveda)
  with Telugu vernacular commentary reflects the author's commitment to making Vedic
  Śaivism accessible to Telugu-language audiences while maintaining scholarly rigor.
