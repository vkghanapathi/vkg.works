status: draft
abstract: A devotional stotra (hymn) of 27 verses composed by Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī
  in classical Sanskrit, celebrating the life, teachings, and spiritual accomplishments
  of Narasimha Saraswati, the incarnate guru of the Dattatreya tradition. Known as
  the Tāravali Stotra due its 27 verses (matching the 27 naksatras or stellar mansions),
  this work eulogizes Narasimha Saraswati's miraculous interventions, pedagogical
  wisdom, and non-dualistic spiritual realization within the sacred landscape of Ganagapur.
preamble: This work belongs to the Dattatreya sampradaya, a major lineage of Hindu
  advaitic monasticism centered on the worship of Dattatreya, the combined manifestation
  of Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva. Narasimha Saraswati (also known as Narahari Saraswati)
  is venerated as a principal avatar and guru-incarnation within this tradition, particularly
  associated with the pilgrimage site of Ganagapur in Karnataka. The stotra functions
  as both devotional praise and hagiographic commemoration, typical of the guru-worship
  practices central to the Dattatreya lineage, and serves practitioners as a daily
  recitative aid for cultivating devotion and receiving the guru's grace.
