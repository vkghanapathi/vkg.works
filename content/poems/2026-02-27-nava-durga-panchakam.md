abstract: A devotional poem in Mandākrāntā metre honouring the nine forms of Durgā
  (Navadurgā), structured in the classical pallavi–anupallavi–charaṇa format with
  elaborate bhāvārtha (philosophical commentary) in Telugu. The work employs seed
  mantras (bīja-mantras) and integrates Śaiva theological concepts with Śākta devotional
  practice, presenting each of the nine goddesses with their mythological associations,
  spiritual attributes, and soteriological functions.
preamble: This composition belongs to the Śākta devotional tradition of South India,
  specifically the Navadurgā worship cycle within Hindu tantra and Puranic theology.
  The nine goddesses—Śailaputrī, Brahmacāriṇī, Chandraghantā, Kūshmāndā, Skandamātā,
  Kātyāyanī, Kālarātrī, Mahāgaurī, and Siddhidātrī—form the traditional sequence of
  Durgā's manifestations during the nine nights of Navratri. The inclusion of Matrikā-tattva
  (the doctrine of the fifty Sanskrit phonemes as divine principles) situates the
  work within Kashmiri Śaivism and Tantra philosophy, where mantric syllables embody
  cosmic forces.
