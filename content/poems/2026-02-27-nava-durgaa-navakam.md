abstract: A Sanskrit devotional hymn comprising nine distinct stanzas, each devoted
  to one of the nine forms of Durgā (Śailaputrī, Brahmacharinī, Chandraghantā, Kūshmandā,
  Skandamātā, Kātyāyanī, Kālarātrī, Mahāgaurī, and Siddhidā). The work employs classical
  Sanskrit poetics to elaborate the metaphysical attributes and soteriological significance
  of each manifestation, concluding with a phala-śruti (fruition verse) that promises
  liberation through devotion to the ninefold goddess.
preamble: This composition belongs to the Navaratri devotional tradition of Hinduism,
  specifically the Durgā Saptaśatī liturgical sphere. The nine forms invoked here
  correspond to the nine nights of Navaratri (or Dussehra), a major annual observance
  celebrating the triumph of the divine feminine principle over cosmic disorder. Rooted
  in the philosophical framework of Śaktism—the recognition of ultimate reality as
  divine feminine power—this hymn integrates Advaitic metaphysics with personified
  deity worship, addressing practitioners across philosophical and devotional registers.
