abstract: A collection of devotional verses in Sanskrit, Telugu, and Kannada celebrating
  ten manifestations of the Divine Feminine principle (Śakti), each associated with
  a major Hindu goddess. The work presents parallel compositions in three Dravidian
  and Indo-Aryan scripts, demonstrating Dr. Ghanapāṭhī's commitment to multilingual
  Sanskrit devotion and the pan-Indian theological understanding of Devi as supreme
  cosmic power across regional traditions.
preamble: 'This composition belongs to the Śākta tradition of Hindu devotionalism,
  which reveres Śakti—the divine feminine energy—as the ultimate source of cosmic
  manifestation and liberation. The work invokes ten major goddess forms recognised
  across Hindu temples and philosophical systems: Gaurī (consort of Śiva), Rājarājeśvarī
  (sovereign queen of the universe), Durgā and Lakṣmī (destroyer of evil and bestower
  of prosperity), Mīnākṣī (the fish-eyed goddess of Tamil Nadu), Parāśakti (transcendent
  power itself), Viśālākṣī (the wide-eyed witness), Saraswatī (wisdom), Caṇḍī (the
  fierce protector), and Śaktidugi (power as remover of obstacles). The trilingual
  presentation honours these goddesses across the Sanskrit, Telugu, and Kannada-speaking
  regions of India.'
