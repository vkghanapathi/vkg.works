title: नीलकण्ठ स्तोत्रम्
date: '2026-02-27'
author: Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī
status: draft
abstract: A Sanskrit devotional hymn of four verses composed by Dr. Vamshi Krishna
  Ghanapāṭhī on 11 July 2021 at Mysore, invoking Lord Śiva in his form as Nīlakaṇṭha
  (the blue-throated one). The stotra addresses contemporary environmental degradation
  and human suffering, drawing theological parallels between Śiva's consumption of
  the Halāhala poison during the churning of the ocean and humanity's careless extraction
  and disposal of toxic substances that corrupt the three realms (earth, water, air).
preamble: This work belongs to the Sanskrit stotra tradition of devotional Hinduism,
  specifically addressing Nīlakaṇṭha Mahadeva, a manifestation of Lord Śiva worshipped
  in the Himalayan region near Ṛṣikeśa (Uttarakhand). The composition draws upon the
  classical mythological narrative of the Samudra Manthan (churning of the cosmic
  ocean), wherein Śiva absorbs the Halāhala venom to preserve the world. The preamble
  indicates that the stotra was composed following a sankalpa (solemn resolve) invoked
  in devotee Ravi Venkataraman during the new moon of Jyeṣṭha month, positioning the
  work within the calendar of Hindu ritual observance.
