abstract: A wedding benediction composed by Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī for the
  marriage of Nīrajā and Chiṁmaya Datta, rendered in three stanzas of Mandākrānta
  metre in Sanskrit with a parallel Telugu version and detailed commentary. The work
  articulates traditional Vedic wishes for the couple's prosperity, dharmic conduct,
  acquisition of vidyā (Brahmavidyā), and fulfilment of household duties prescribed
  in śruti.
preamble: This benedictory poem belongs to the Sanskrit courtly and scholarly tradition
  of auspicious verse (āśīrvachana padya) presented at matrimonial occasions within
  Brahmanical communities. Rooted in Vedic orthopraxy and the gṛhastha āśrama (householder
  stage), the work invokes the classical metre Mandākrānta to confer blessings upon
  the newlyweds, referencing the Śāndilyā gotra lineage, the study of Vedic texts
  (Ṛgveda), Upaniṣadic knowledge (Brahmavidyā), and the integration of dharma, artha,
  and ānanda within matrimonial life.
