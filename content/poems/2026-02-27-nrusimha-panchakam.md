abstract: Pañcakam is a Sanskrit devotional hymn of five stanzas addressed to Narasiṃha,
  the Man-Lion avatar of Viṣṇu, structured around a repeated refrain of obeisance.
  Each verse petitions the deity for specific spiritual blessings—removal of worldly
  thorns, dissolution of jealousy and enmity, gracious acceptance of worship, right
  speech, and the fruits of devotion—culminating in a concluding couplet that promises
  assured attainment of the five-stanza composition to the faithful reciter.
preamble: This work belongs to the Vaiṣṇava bhakti tradition, specifically within
  the devotional corpus addressed to Narasiṃha, one of the ten principal avatars (daśāvatāra)
  of Viṣṇu in Hindu theology. The Pañcakam exemplifies the Sanskrit stotram (hymn)
  genre, in which practitioners invoke divine qualities and petition the deity for
  both material and spiritual welfare. The fixed refrain structure and the explicit
  promise of spiritual fruit (phala-śruti) at the conclusion identify this as a liturgical
  devotional text suitable for regular recitation in worship, reflecting the broader
  Vaiṣṇava emphasis on namegiving, hymn-singing, and the salvific power of devoted
  utterance.
