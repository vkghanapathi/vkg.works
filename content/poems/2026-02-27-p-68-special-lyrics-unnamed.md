status: draft
abstract: This work presents a systematic phonetic and rhythmic inventory of Sanskrit
  word-endings and verbal stems, organized alphabetically by terminal sounds and phonetic
  clusters. The list exemplifies Dr. Ghanapāṭhī's pedagogical method of isolating
  lexical units for memorization and recitation practice, a foundational technique
  in Vedic oral transmission and classical Sanskrit philology.
preamble: This composition operates within the ghanapāṭhī tradition—a specialized
  system of Vedic recitation that emphasizes precise phonetic articulation, melodic
  contour, and rhythmic accuracy through structured repetition of phonetic units and
  word-families. By organizing Sanskrit words under the title श्रीराम (Śrīrāma), the
  work invokes the sacred name while employing it as a mnemonic framework for linguistic
  material. This approach reflects the Indian scholarly tradition of using sacred
  nomenclature to sanctify and systematize grammatical and philological study, integrating
  devotion with intellectual rigor.
