abstract: A devotional poem of five Sanskrit verses (with Telugu transliteration)
  dedicated to the grace and protection of Hari (Viṣṇu). Each verse employs anaphoric
  repetition of the relative pronoun yayā ('by which') to enumerate the divine attributes
  and saving power of Hari's radiance, culminating in a benedictory refrain requesting
  that this luminosity dwell eternally in the speaker's heart. The work concludes
  with a phalaśruti promising spiritual benefits to those who recite it with exclusive
  devotion to Vāsudeva.
preamble: This composition belongs to the bhakti-prayayana (devotional) strand of
  Hindu philosophical literature, specifically within the Vaiṣṇava tradition centred
  on the worship of Kṛṣṇa and Viṣṇu. The work draws upon established conventions of
  stotra (hymnic praise) in Sanskrit and employs the classical technique of anaphora
  to create a cumulative invocation of divine grace. Its inclusion in bilingual Sanskrit-Telugu
  form reflects the cultural synthesis characteristic of South Indian Vaiṣṇavism,
  where Sanskrit philosophical rigour and Telugu devotional accessibility coexist.
  The phalaśruti appended at the end situates the poem within the frame of ritual
  efficacy, suggesting liturgical or contemplative use.
