title: तं विन्दै महितार्थबोधमनिशं श्रीराम योगेश्वर।।

status: draft
abstract: A devotional poem sequence of fourteen verses addressed to Śrī Rāma as Yogeśvara
  (the Lord of Yoga), systematically addressing the stages of yogic practice and the
  eventual dissolution of the physical body. The work guides the practitioner through
  embodied illusion, sense withdrawal, vital breath control, and final liberation,
  culminating in ritual prescriptions for the departed soul's journey and the proper
  disposition of earthly wealth and attachments.
preamble: This composition belongs to the Sanskrit devotional and philosophical poetry
  tradition of Hindu Yoga practice, specifically within the framework of Advaita Vedānta
  and tantric approaches to liberation. The verses are structured as a meditation
  manual addressed to Rāma in his form as Yogeśvara, the supreme teacher of yoga who
  embodies both transcendent consciousness and the knowledge of embodied practice.
  The work draws on Upaniṣadic teachings on the nature of self (ātman), the dissolution
  of identification with the body-mind complex, and the proper discharge of funeral
  and ancestral rituals (śrāddha and pinda karma) as specified in Vedic protocols.
