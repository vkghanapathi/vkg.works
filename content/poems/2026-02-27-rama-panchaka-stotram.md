abstract: Rāma Pañcaka Stotram is a devotional hymn composed by Dr. Vamshi Krishna
  Ghanapāṭhī in Sanskrit, consisting of five verses (pañcaka) honouring Lord Rāma.
  Composed specifically for the inaugural Rāma Navamī celebration at the new Ayodhya
  Dham Temple (17 April 2024), the work employs five distinct verbal formations (jayatu,
  tudatu, dišatu, bhajatu, bhavatu) to invoke blessings of dharma, protection, prosperity,
  devotion, and purification.
preamble: The stotram belongs to the Sanskrit devotional tradition of Rāma worship,
  the cult centred on the deified hero of the Rāmāyaṇa epic. Stotra literature—formal
  hymns of praise and petition—constitutes a principal vehicle for expressing bhakti
  (devotional sentiment) within Hindu religious practice. This particular composition
  aligns with the observance of Rāma Navamī, the annual celebration of Rāma's birth,
  and situates itself explicitly within a contemporary temple context, bridging classical
  Sanskrit composition with modern pilgrimage sites associated with the mythological
  geography of Ayodhyā.
