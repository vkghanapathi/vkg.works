abstract: Sachchidānanda Tāravali is a devotional stotra (hymn) of 27 Sanskrit verses
  composed by Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī in praise of Sri Ganapath Sachchidānanda
  Sadguru, a twentieth-century spiritual preceptor of the Datta Sampradāya. Each verse
  follows a refrain structure (pallavi) celebrating the guru's manifestation of Dattātreya,
  his establishment of spiritual seats (pīṭha), preservation of Vedic learning, and
  dispensation of liberation (mokṣa) to his devotees.
preamble: This work belongs to the hagiographic and eulogistic literature of the Dattātreya
  tradition, a lineage within Advaita Vedānta that venerates the deity Dattātreya
  as the supreme embodiment of Brahman appearing in three-form (Brahma, Vishnu, Maheśvara).
  The Tāravali genre—a string or garland of verses—is a classical Sanskrit poetic
  form used extensively for guru-stuti (guru-praise) and deity-worship in Indian devotional
  literature. Tāravali compositions typically comprise multiples of nine or twenty-seven
  verses, each adhering to a metrically and thematically unified refrain. This particular
  composition integrates biographical allusions (references to named Vedic lineages
  such as Bhāradwaja and Yājñika clans, and Mysore's Chāmundi Hill seat) with metaphysical
  praise, reflecting the guru's role as custodian of Vedic knowledge and liberator
  of his disciples.
