abstract: Samudra-stotram is a devotional hymn of ten verses addressing the Ocean
  (Samudra) as a divine entity worthy of worship and propitiation. The composition
  celebrates the Ocean's cosmological significance, beneficent qualities, and role
  in Hindu sacred narrative, while prescribing the recitation of the hymn during ritual
  bathing as a means of spiritual purification and merit accumulation.
preamble: This work belongs to the Sanskrit stotram (hymn of praise) tradition, a
  genre of devotional poetry that venerates deities and sacred natural phenomena within
  Hindu cosmology. The Ocean occupies a complex position in Vedic and Puranic literature
  as both a geographical reality and a divine force—the abode of wealth, the boundary
  of the cosmos, and the setting for pivotal mythological events. This stotram situates
  the Ocean within the broader framework of Hindu ritual practice and bhakti (devotional)
  worship, invoking it as Jaladhīśa (Lord of Waters), witness to the sage Nārada,
  supporter of the universe, and familial relation to Viṣṇu. The hymn's concluding
  verse prescribes its recitation during ablutions, linking cosmological reverence
  to personal spiritual discipline.
