title: शङ्कर गुरु षट्कम्
date: '2026-02-27'

status: draft
abstract: A devotional hymn of six stanzas in Sanskrit, Telugu, and Kannada composed
  by Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī in praise of Śaṅkara, the preeminent Advaita Vedānta
  philosopher and guru. The work celebrates Śaṅkara's role as the restorer of Vedic
  dharma, the defender of non-dual Brahman, and the supreme spiritual guide, while
  invoking his teachings on mokṣa and the unity of existence.
preamble: This composition belongs to the tradition of guru-stuti (guru-praise) and
  advaya-vāda (non-dual philosophy), drawing deeply from Advaita Vedānta as systematized
  by Ādi Śaṅkara in the 8th century. The hymn situates Śaṅkara within the lineage
  of Vedic interpreters (particularly referencing Bādarāyaṇa and the Brahma-sūtra-bhāṣya)
  and frames him as a liberator who dispels sectarian confusion and establishes the
  supremacy of the Absolute. Each stanza reiterates the refrain of seeking refuge
  in Śaṅkara as both cosmic and personal guide (bhuvī śaṅkaram, mam śaṅkaram), a classical
  devotional structure adapted to express philosophical devotion.
