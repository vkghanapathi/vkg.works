abstract: A devotional hymnic composition in Telugu dedicated to Śiva, structured
  as twelve thematic sections (prārthanā, tīrtha-sthānam, archanam, etc.) that trace
  Śiva's cosmic roles and manifest grace. The work integrates petition, pilgrimage
  geography, ritual worship, and soteriological promise, culminating in a phala-śruti
  affirming that recitation conjoined with Rudra-mantra and Rāma-nāma yields liberation
  through Śiva's prasāda.
preamble: This composition belongs to the Śaiva devotional tradition of Telugu Vaishnavism-influenced
  syncretism, wherein Śiva is invoked as supreme godhead (Parameśvara) through both
  iconic worship (archanam) and mantra recitation (nāma-kīrtana). The work references
  canonical Śaiva practices—Rudra-yāga, abhiṣeka, and Vedic ritual—while simultaneously
  adopting the bhakti register of emotional petition and divine surrender characteristic
  of South Indian temple devotion. Its invocation of sacred sites (Ayodhyā, Kāśī,
  Śrīśailam) reflects the pilgrimage theology embedded in Śaiva Āgama and Sanskrit
  stotras, adapted into vernacular Telugu metres and vocabulary.
