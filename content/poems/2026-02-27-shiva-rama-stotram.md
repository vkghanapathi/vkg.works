abstract: Deva Dvādaśī Stotram is a twelve-fold hymnic composition dedicated to Lord
  Śiva, structured as a liturgical prayer incorporating invocation, sacred geography,
  worship procedures, mythological narrative, and benedictory conclusions. The work
  synthesizes Vedic ritual language (Rudra Yāga terminology), devotional Sanskrit
  poetics, and Tantric theological concepts, presenting Śiva in his multivalent aspects
  as creator, destroyer, benefactor, and transcendent reality.
preamble: This composition belongs to the Śaiva devotional and liturgical tradition,
  particularly drawing on the Rudrayāmala and Śaiva Āgamic frameworks. The text is
  organized according to classical stotram structure (invocation, territorial/sacred
  site specification, worship performance, mythic meditation, and results of recitation),
  reflecting post-Vedic Hindu ritual systematization. The dual-language presentation
  in Sanskrit and Telugu indicates its usage within South Indian temple contexts,
  likely associated with the worship of Śiva during specific ritual calendars (dvādaśī—twelfth
  lunar day observances). The work demonstrates the integration of Vedic mantra science
  (Om Namah Śivāya), epic narrative motifs (Tripurāntaka—destruction of the three
  cities), and bhakti sensibility.
