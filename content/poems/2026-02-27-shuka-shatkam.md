abstract: A devotional hymn sequence in Sanskrit composed to honour Śuka Mahārṣi,
  the legendary sage and principal narrator of the Bhāgavata Purāṇa. The six verses
  employ parallel structures and ascending spiritual attributes to commemorate Śuka's
  role as teacher, his embodiment of non-dualistic wisdom, and his transmission of
  salvific knowledge to King Parīkṣit.
preamble: This work belongs to the Sanskrit devotional and panegyric tradition centred
  on Hindu philosophical lineages. Śuka Mahārṣi occupies a unique position in Vedantic
  scripture as the son of Vyāsa (the composer of the Vedas and Purāṇas) and the primary
  exponent of the Bhāgavata Purāṇa—one of the most authoritative texts on bhakti (devotion)
  and mokṣa (liberation). The verses here situate Śuka within a continuum of Vedic
  and Purāṇic philosophy, celebrating his extraordinary spiritual attainment and his
  pedagogical transmission of esoteric knowledge to the dying king Parīkṣit.
