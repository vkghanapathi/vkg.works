status: draft
abstract: The Śrī Datta Śatakam is a devotional hymnic composition of one hundred
  Sanskrit verses (ślokas) dedicated to Lord Dattātreya, composed by Vamshi Krishna
  Ghanapāṭhī and consecrated during the Devī Śaraṇ Navratri festival and Sarasvatī
  Pūjā observance on 13 October 2010. The work systematically expounds the metaphysical
  nature, divine incarnation, genealogy, nomenclature, supremacy, Vedic association,
  trinitarian symbolism, transcendental attributes, and ascetic conduct of Dattātreya
  through the traditional verse framework of the Śataka (century) form.
preamble: This composition belongs to the Dattātreya bhakti tradition within Advaita
  Vedānta practice, venerating Dattātreya as the unified manifestation of Brahmā,
  Viṣṇu, and Śiva. Dattātreya is recognized in Hindu scriptural tradition as a paradigmatic
  guru-figure and embodied teaching principle (avatāra) whose doctrine synthesizes
  Vedic knowledge and renunciation. The work situates itself within the commemoration
  of Dattātreya Jayantī—the birth anniversary of the deity—and invokes the patronage
  of contemporary realized masters (Śrī Gaṇapati Saccidānanda Svāmī and other avadhūta
  gurus) whose lineage preserves this philosophical and spiritual transmission.
