status: draft
abstract: A devotional Sanskrit and Telugu octet (aṣṭakam) composed by Dr. Vamshi
  Krishna Ghanapāṭhī that celebrates Śrīnivāsa (Viṣṇu) through philosophical and theological
  reflection. The poem integrates Vedantic metaphysics with Vaiṣṇava bhakti, exploring
  the supreme nature of the deity across eight verses that address his transcendence,
  cosmic manifestation, and role as the ultimate arbiter of karma and cosmic order.
preamble: This work belongs to the Vaiṣṇava devotional tradition of South India, specifically
  venerating Śrīnivāsa as the presiding deity of Tirupati (Venkataachala). The aṣṭakam
  genre is a standard eight-verse hymn form in Sanskrit poetry, often used for philosophical
  and ritual praise. Dr. Ghanapāṭhī's composition draws on Vedantic doctrine (particularly
  the metaphysics of Brahman and Viṣṇu tattva) while maintaining the lyrical and devotional
  intensity characteristic of temple hymnody. The work appears in his collection on
  sacred site pilgrimage (Śrī Venkataachala Kṣetra Darśanam) and carries explicit
  phala-śruti (fruit of recitation) benedictions typical of ritual compositions.
