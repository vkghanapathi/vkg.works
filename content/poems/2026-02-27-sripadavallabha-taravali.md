abstract: The Śrīpadavallabha Tāravali Stotra is a devotional hymn composed by Śrī
  Gaṇapati Saccidānanda Svāmi that celebrates the life, teachings, and divine attributes
  of Śrīpadavallabha, the avatar of Dattātreya revered in South Indian bhakti tradition.
  The work narrates key episodes from Śrīpadavallabha's life—including his miraculous
  birth, austerities, and salvific interventions—while establishing Pīṭhāpuram as
  his primary sacred seat and dwelling place. Through repeated invocations structured
  as a tāravali (garland of verses), the stotra functions as both biographical account
  and liturgical prayer, offering spiritual protection and blessings to the devotee.
preamble: This work belongs to the Dattātreya devotional tradition of South India,
  particularly the Śrīpadavallabha sampradāya centered at Pīṭhāpuram in Andhra Pradesh.
  Śrīpadavallabha (16th century) is venerated as a full avatar of Dattātreya, the
  primordial guru of Advaita Vedānta and Nātha philosophy, known for embodying absolute
  non-duality (advaya) and the principle of liberation without impediment (anagha).
  Stotras dedicated to avatars serve as ritual and devotional instruments within Vaiṣṇava,
  Śaiva, and syncretistic Hindu temples, functioning simultaneously as praise, historical
  record, and means of spiritual transmission. The Tāravali Stotra maintains the classical
  form of Sanskrit-Telugu devotional poetry while embedding local hagiography within
  the broader metaphysical framework of Vedāntic philosophy.
