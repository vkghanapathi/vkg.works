title: सूर्य सप्तकम् - विकृतिः छन्दः - अश्वललित वृत्तम्

status: draft
abstract: A devotional composition on the sun deity (Sūrya) structured in the Aśvalalita
  metre, a classical Sanskrit prosodic form. This work exemplifies Dr. Vamshi Krishna's
  scholarly engagement with both metrical theory and religious poetry, demonstrating
  how technical verse constraints serve devotional expression through elaborate praise-hymns
  addressing the solar orb's cosmological and soteriological significance.
preamble: This composition belongs to the Sanskrit devotional hymn tradition (stotram)
  dedicated to Sūrya, the Vedic solar deity whose worship spans Vedic ritual, Puranic
  theology, and classical Hinduism. The work situates itself within the framwork of
  chandas-śāstra (Sanskrit prosody) by employing the Aśvalalita metre—a complex vṛtta
  (fixed metrical form) enumerated in classical prosodic treatises. The seven-verse
  structure (saptaka) reflects a traditional form popular in both Tantric and Śaivite
  devotional literature, while the inclusion of metrical annotations and etymological
  glosses indicates a pedagogical intent alongside spiritual aspiration.
