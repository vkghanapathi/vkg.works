abstract: A devotional lyric poem addressed to Lord Krishna (Hari), celebrating the
  lotus-like beauty of his face and the nectar of his divine form. The composition
  employs classical Sanskrit poetic conventions to express the speaker's yearning
  for Krishna's grace to manifest within the heart (hṛdaya-tāḍāga), positioning Krishna
  as the ultimate refuge who dispels the burden of worldly suffering for devoted souls.
preamble: This work belongs to the Bhakti literary tradition, specifically the Krishna-centered
  devotional poetry of medieval Sanskrit composition. It draws upon the established
  conventions of the Bhāgavata Purāṇa and Vaiṣṇava philosophical traditions, wherein
  Krishna (also invoked here as Hari, the remover of suffering, and as the enemy of
  Mura—murashatrō) is venerated as the supreme divine principle. The poem invokes
  classical imagery of lotus symbolism (tamarasa, nayanalini) common to Sanskrit erotic
  and devotional aesthetics, transposing sensory beauty into a vehicle for spiritual
  realization. Such compositions typically functioned within temple recitation, private
  devotional practice, and scholarly courtly contexts.
