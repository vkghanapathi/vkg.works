abstract: 'A devotional eulogy in Sanskrit verse celebrating Sri Padavallabha, a form
  or avatar of Datta Paramatman, with detailed hagiographic accounts of his miraculous
  interventions and spiritual authority. The work comprises two interconnected stotra
  (hymns): the Sri Padavallabha Taravali Stotra (attributed to Ganapatī Saccidānanda
  Svāmī of the Avdhuta Datta Sampradāya) and a parallel Nrisimha Sarasvati Taravali
  Stotra, establishing the lineage of Datta-avatars across sacred pilgrimage sites
  (Pithapuram and Ganagapur). The text functions both as a liturgical praise-poem
  and as doctrinal validation of Datta Sampradāya theology.'
preamble: This work belongs to the Avdhuta Datta Sampradāya (also called Datta Sampradāya),
  a Vedantic monastic order venerating Sri Dattatreya as the Trimurti-incarnate and
  his successive human avatars as spiritual guides. The Datta tradition synthesizes
  Advaita Vedānta philosophy with Tantric ritual practice and bhakti devotionalism,
  emphasizing guru-śishya transmission and the redemptive power of divine descent
  (avatāra). Pithapuram and Ganagapur function as primary tīrthas (pilgrimage sites)
  where Padavallabha and Nrisimha Sarasvati respectively established monastic lineages.
  The Taravali stotra genre—a narrative-biographical hymn—serves both contemplative
  and congregational worship purposes within this sampradāya.
