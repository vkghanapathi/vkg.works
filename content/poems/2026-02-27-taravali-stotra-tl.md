abstract: Saccidānanda Tāravali Stotram is a devotional hymn of twenty-eight verses
  composed in Telugu by Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī, celebrating Sri Ganapatī (Gaṇeśa)
  as the Saccidānanda Sadguru (the Satguru embodying Existence-Consciousness-Bliss).
  The work enumerates the guru's manifold spiritual accomplishments and graces—from
  establishing sacred seats and temples dedicated to Datta avatāras, to propagating
  Vedic and Śāstric learning, music, non-dualistic philosophy, and the salvific practice
  of divine name-remembrance—structured as a repeated refrain of benediction.
preamble: This stotram belongs to the Datta Sampradāya, a Hindu lineage of renunciate
  spirituality centred on Dattātreya as the supreme guru principle. The work honours
  Saccidānanda Satguru as a contemporary embodiment of this tradition, drawing upon
  classical Sanskrit eulogy conventions (stotram, jayatu-meter, and anaphoric blessing
  formulas) while composed in Telugu to make the teaching accessible to vernacular
  devotees. The composition situates the guru within a cosmography of multiple Datta
  temples and seats across the Indian subcontinent, emphasizing his role in transmitting
  Vedic knowledge, yogic science, and bhakti (devotional surrender) to seekers of
  mokṣa (liberation).
