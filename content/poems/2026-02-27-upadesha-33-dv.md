abstract: Upadesh Ratnavali – Sajan Patham is a devotional and ethical instruction
  manual composed in Sanskrit verse, organized as a series of practical life lessons
  framed within Hindu ritual and spiritual practice. The work presents ethical conduct
  (dharma), worship practices, and spiritual disciplines through the lens of essential
  daily rituals—from sun salutation and Ganesha puja to proper conduct toward teachers
  and elders—culminating in the attainment of sat-chit-ananda (being, consciousness,
  bliss).
preamble: This work belongs to the Hindu tradition of didactic Sanskrit literature
  (upadesh kavya) and draws from the Vedic worldview of the four varnas and four ashramas
  (varnaśrama dharma). It synthesizes classical Hindu ritual procedures (including
  puja, tīrtha-snāna, and nīrājana) with the Advaita Vedantic goal of realizing sat-chit-ananda.
  The composition reflects the pedagogical method found in dharmaśāstra literature,
  using metrical verse to encode practical and philosophical instruction for students
  or householders seeking to balance ethical duty, ritual observance, and spiritual
  realization within the framework of devotion to Hari and Śiva.
