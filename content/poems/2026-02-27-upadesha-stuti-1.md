abstract: Upadhesa Stuti 1 is a devotional Sanskrit poem composed by Dr. Vamshi Krishna
  Ghanapāṭhī that presents ethical and spiritual guidance through verse. The work
  combines hymnic praise of Govinda (Krishna) with practical moral instruction, offering
  a synthesis of bhakti (devotion), dharma (righteousness), and philosophical illumination
  (Sat-Chit-Ananda consciousness). The accompanying Telugu exegesis elucidates each
  Sanskrit shloka line-by-line, making the teachings accessible to vernacular audiences.
preamble: This work participates in the Sanskrit devotional and didactic tradition
  that draws from the Bhagavad Gita and Upanishadic philosophy, particularly the doctrine
  of Sat-Chit-Ananda (Being-Consciousness-Bliss) central to Advaita Vedanta. The poem
  addresses the practitioner (sādhaka) directly, invoking Govinda and Sridhara (epithets
  of Vishnu/Krishna) while prescribing the cultivation of virtue, renunciation of
  vices, cultivation of satsanga (virtuous company), and the ultimate realization
  of non-dual consciousness. This pedagogical approach reflects the guru-disciple
  transmission model foundational to Indian spiritual literature.
