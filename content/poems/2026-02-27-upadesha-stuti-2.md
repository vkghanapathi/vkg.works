abstract: ఉపదేశ స్తుతిः 2 is a devotional hymn celebrating the efficacy of ritual
  purification through sacred waters and worship of Śiva. The poem juxtaposes the
  meritorious effects of pilgrimage bathing at renowned tīrthas (Gaṅgā, Prayāg, Narmadā,
  and Mānasa Lake) with the supreme spiritual realisation attained through Śiva's
  worship, arguing that direct communion with the deity through ritual ablation (abhiṣeka)
  of the liṅga transcends and encompasses all lesser forms of purification.
preamble: This work belongs to the Tamil-Telugu devotional tradition of Śaiva bhakti,
  wherein the supremacy of Śiva worship is asserted through structured philosophical
  argument. The hymn draws upon the classical Purāṇic corpus, which establishes sacred
  geography through tīrtha-māhātmya (glorification of pilgrimage sites), while simultaneously
  inverting the hierarchy to privilege direct ritualistic devotion to Śiva over external
  acts of merit-accumulation. The accompanying bhāva (interpretive commentary) in
  Telugu prose elucidates each Sanskrit verse, making the theological argument accessible
  to vernacular audiences—a characteristic pedagogical method of classical Indic scholarly
  transmission.
