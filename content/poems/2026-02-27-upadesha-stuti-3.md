abstract: Upadesastuti 3 is a devotional hymn that employs the metaphor of a ghee
  lamp lit with camphor to convey non-dual Vedantic philosophy and yogic praxis. Through
  the symbolism of multiple flames, the poem articulates the unity of Brahman, the
  relationship between Paramātman and Jīvātman, the three worlds, the four puruṣārthas
  (human aims), and the five prāṇa-vāyus (vital airs), presenting spiritual knowledge
  as illumination granted through the grace of the Divine Mother.
preamble: This work belongs to the Vedantic devotional poetry tradition, drawing upon
  Upaniṣadic philosophy and Śākta theology. The text combines elements of Advaita
  Vedānta metaphysics with Tāntric and Yogic anatomical-spiritual frameworks, particularly
  the doctrine of the five vital airs (prāṇa, apāna, vyāna, udāna, samāna). The lamp
  ritual (dīpa-darśana) serves as both a liturgical act and an epistemological symbol,
  wherein the illumination of consciousness is understood through the gradual revelation
  of cosmic and individual principles. Dr. Vamshi Krishna provides detailed philosophical
  commentary (bhāva) alongside the original verse, making explicit the multi-layered
  correspondences embedded in the poem's imagery.
