abstract: A devotional hymn (stotra) addressed to Gaṇapati (Ganesha), the elephant-headed
  deity of Hindu tradition, composed in Classical Sanskrit with metrical rigour. The
  poem employs ritual invocation and propitiation language, requesting the removal
  of obstacles (vighna), the bestowal of wisdom (medha), prosperity, and spiritual
  grace, while enumerating traditional offerings of durva grass, modaka, and oblations
  in fire sacrifice.
preamble: This work belongs to the stotra or laudatory hymn tradition of Hindu devotional
  literature, specifically addressing Gaṇapati, the remover of obstacles and lord
  of beginnings venerated across Sanskrit and vernacular Hindu practice. The composition
  draws on the ritual grammar of Vedic and post-Vedic propitiation, invoking the deity
  through both direct address (vandi-svaag) and enumeration of prescribed sacrificial
  offerings (homa, durva, modaka, samidha). The work reflects the continued vitality
  of Sanskrit devotional composition in modern scholarly and priestly contexts, blending
  classical poetic form with theological aspiration toward wisdom (medha), prosperity
  (sampada), and spiritual realisation (sat-chit-ananda).
