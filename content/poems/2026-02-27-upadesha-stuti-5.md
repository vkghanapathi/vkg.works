abstract: This devotional hymn presents twelve Sanskrit epithets and names of the
  Sun deity (Sūrya), each paired with theological commentary in Telugu. The work exemplifies
  a teaching method (upadeśa) that combines Sanskrit mantra with vernacular exegesis,
  demonstrating how multiple solar designations—Mitra, Ravi, Bhānu, Hiranyagarbha,
  Ādityā, Sāvitr, Arka, and Bhāskara—represent different cosmic and soteriological
  functions of a single divine principle.
preamble: 'This composition belongs to the devotional tradition of solar worship (Sūrya-pūjā)
  within Hindu philosophy, drawing on Vedic hymns to Āditya and later Puranic theology.
  The pedagogical format—Sanskrit verse followed by detailed Telugu word-by-word and
  semantic exegesis (bhāvamu)—reflects a teaching method common in medieval South
  Indian vernacular commentarial traditions. The invocation culminates in a soteriological
  promise: twelve daily recitations grant not merely physical health (ārogya) but
  also the spiritual state of sat-cit-ānanda (being, consciousness, bliss), linking
  solar worship to non-dual metaphysical attainment.'
