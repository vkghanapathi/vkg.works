status: draft
abstract: The sixth poem of Upadesasthuti presents a philosophical inquiry into the
  nature of Brahman, articulated through classical Sanskrit verse with Telugu exegetical
  commentary. The composition synthesizes Vedantic doctrine by enumerating the essential
  attributes of ultimate reality—unity, auspiciousness, truth, consciousness, infinity,
  immutability, and transcendence of space-time—before culminating in the non-dual
  recognition of Brahman as Sat-Chit-Ananda (being, consciousness, bliss).
preamble: This work belongs to the Vedantic philosophical tradition, specifically
  the lineage of Advaita Vedanta as expounded in the Upaniṣads. The poem engages directly
  with the classical Vedic question 'Kim Brahma?' (What is Brahman?)—a foundational
  inquiry found throughout the Upaniṣadic corpus. By pairing Sanskrit verse with vernacular
  Telugu glosses, Dr. Ghanapāṭhī makes this metaphysical inquiry accessible while
  preserving the precision of traditional philosophical terminology. The methodological
  approach reflects the gurukulic pedagogical model wherein a teacher (sakhi, 'friend')
  guides the student through scriptural understanding via both etymological analysis
  and conceptual elaboration.
