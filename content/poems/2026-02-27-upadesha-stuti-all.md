abstract: ఉపదేశ స్తుతిः (Upadēśa Stuti) is a didactic devotional poem comprising four
  instructional hymns that synthesise Vedantic philosophy with practical ethical guidance.
  Each section employs iconic imagery—divine worship, sacred bathing, ritual lamp-lighting,
  and Ganesh propitiation—as vehicles for teaching dharma, mental discipline, and
  the realisation of Sat-Chit-Ānanda (consciousness-existence-bliss). The work demonstrates
  Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī's characteristic approach of embedding philosophical
  doctrine within accessible devotional verse.
preamble: This work belongs to the Telugu devotional-philosophical tradition (bhakti-advaita)
  and draws from core Vedantic concepts including Brahman, ātman-paramātman distinction,
  and the four puruṣārthas (dharma, artha, kāma, mokṣa). It is structured as a sequence
  of stotras (hymns of praise) addressing different deities and sacred principles—Govinda
  (Krishna), Śiva, and the cosmic Śakti—each serving as a pedagogical framework. The
  composition illustrates the integration of ritual practice (pūjā, snāna, homa) with
  spiritual aspiration, characteristic of the Vedānta schools that inform contemporary
  Telugu religious scholarship.
