abstract: A devotional benedictory poem (aśīrvāda) dedicated to the Uttara Tirupati
  shrine, invoking the blessings of Lord Venkateśvara in his northern manifestation.
  The composition celebrates the presence of multiple deities within this sacred space—Hanumān,
  Grahamaṇḍala, Gaṇapati, Dattātreya, and Śiva—alongside Padmāvatī, and petitions
  the deity to bestow prosperity, health, courage, longevity, and the fulfilment of
  devotees' aspirations.
preamble: This work belongs to the Śrī Vaiṣṇava devotional tradition centred on the
  Tirupati temple complex in southern India. The poem functions as a maṅgala-āśāsana
  (auspicious benediction), a genre of devotional composition that ritually sanctifies
  a sacred space through praise and invocation. Uttara Tirupati, the northern shrine,
  holds particular significance within the broader Tirupati sacred geography, and
  this poem reinforces its liturgical and spiritual authority by articulating the
  complex of deities present at the site and their interrelated powers of grace.
