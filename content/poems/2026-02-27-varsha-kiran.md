abstract: This poem from the Śrīmān Veṅkaṭapūrvaka Phanikirañ is a devotional invocation
  blessing the parents of Śrī Lakṣmī, the divine bride. The work exemplifies classical
  Sanskrit court poetry (kāvya) integrated with Vaiṣṇava philosophical and liturgical
  perspectives, employing sophisticated metrical and rhetorical conventions to eulogize
  familial relationships sanctified through association with the divine consort.
preamble: The Phanikirañ is a Sanskrit poetic composition belonging to the Śrīvaiṣṇava
  theological and devotional tradition, which venerates Viṣṇu and his consort Lakṣmī
  as the supreme divine principles. This work participates in the broader Vaiṣṇava
  literary corpus that celebrates divine embodiments and their relationships through
  meticulously crafted verses. The poem invokes blessings upon the parents (mātāpitarau)
  of the goddess, situating them within a framework of spiritual merit (sadvikāsa),
  proper lineage (anvaya), and association with realized teachers (sadguru), thereby
  sanctifying familial bonds through devotional rhetoric.
