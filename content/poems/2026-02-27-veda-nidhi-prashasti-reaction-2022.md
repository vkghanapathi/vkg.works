title: वेदनिधिप्रशस्ति ग्रहणम् - अन्तरङ्गाविष्कारः
date: '2026-02-27'
author: Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī
status: draft
abstract: A devotional praise poem (stotra) commemorating Dr. Vamshi Krishna's engagement
  with the Veda-Nidhis (collections of Vedic knowledge) and his spiritual journey
  under the guidance of his guru, Śrī Datta Vijayānanda-tīrtha. The work celebrates
  both the author's intellectual achievement in his fiftieth year of Vedic study and
  the grace of non-dual wisdom (advaita-bodha) received through his guru's compassionate
  teachings, situating scholarly attainment within a framework of devotional gratitude
  and spiritual realisation.
preamble: This poem belongs to the tradition of guru-bhakti (devotion to the spiritual
  teacher) and Vedantic eulogy within Advaita Vedānta circles. The work invokes the
  lineage of Datta Vijayānanda-tīrtha, an established figure in Advaita teaching,
  and reflects the classical practice of composing stotras to acknowledge both intellectual
  mastery of Vedic texts and the inner spiritual transformation facilitated by guru-grace.
  The poem employs the language of ritual consecration (abhiṣeka) and non-dual realisation
  (advaita-bodha) typical of South Indian Vedāntic devotionalism.
