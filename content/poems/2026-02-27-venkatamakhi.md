abstract: A devotional poetic composition celebrating Śrī Veṅkaṭa Makhī, a renowned
  classical Indian music theorist and scholar. The work employs multilingual verse
  in Sanskrit and Telugu, praising Makhī's enduring intellectual legacy and his authoritative
  contributions to the doctrine and philosophy of classical Indian music (śāstrīya
  saṅgīta), positioning him as a master navigator of the musical tradition's theoretical
  foundations.
preamble: This work situates itself within the Indian classical music tradition (śāstrīya
  saṅgīta), specifically honoring Veṅkaṭa Makhī, the 17th-century music theorist and
  author of the Chaturdaṇḍī Prakāśikā, a foundational treatise on Hindustani and Carnatic
  musical systems. The composition draws on the Sanskrit-Telugu bilingual scholarly
  culture of South Indian courts and temple establishments, where music theory (saṅgīta
  śāstra) was cultivated as both a philosophical discipline and a devotional practice.
  By invoking Makhī's doctrine across multiple linguistic registers, the poem reinforces
  his canonical status in the oral and written transmission of classical music knowledge.
