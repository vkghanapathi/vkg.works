title: 1. अथातो ब्रह्मजिज्ञासा

status: draft
abstract: A devotional poem cycle in classical Sanskrit that expounds the nature of
  Brahman and the path to liberation (mokṣa) through Vedantic knowledge, structured
  as philosophical meditations on the opening aphorisms of the Brahma Sutras. The
  work combines rigorous scriptural exegesis with lyrical devotion, offering both
  systematic Advaita Vedanta doctrine and a personal invocation of vidyā (liberating
  knowledge) as the grace-bestowing principle.
preamble: This composition belongs to the Advaita Vedanta tradition of Hindu philosophy,
  anchoring itself in the Brahma Sutras (Bādarāyaṇa's aphorisms on Brahman) and the
  Upaniṣadic teachings. Written in the style of philosophical devotional verse (stuti),
  the work weaves together scriptural citations and logical discourse with repeated
  invocations of vidyā—understood as the transcendent knowledge that alone removes
  ignorance and bestows the bliss of self-realization. The author engages with classical
  commentarial traditions while maintaining a lyrical spiritual address throughout.
