abstract: A Sanskrit devotional hymn in five stanzas composed on 4 March 2013 in Varanasi,
  honouring Viśvānātha (Viśveśvara), the presiding deity of Kāśī. The work employs
  a refrain structure celebrating the god's cosmic sovereignty and salvific power
  while invoking his protection from the five afflictions—anger, lust, delusion, pride,
  and greed—that bind souls to suffering.
preamble: This work belongs to the Hindu devotional and panegyric tradition of stotra
  (hymns of praise), specifically addressing Viśveśvara, one of the twelve cardinal
  manifestations (jyotirliṅga) of Śiva. Kāśī (Varanasi) holds supreme soteriological
  significance in Hindu theology as the tirtha most conducive to liberation (mokṣa).
  The composition invokes the deity as supreme lord (sarvéśvara), cosmic sustainer,
  and protector of the virtuous, drawing on theological concepts from Advaita Vedānta
  and Śaiva philosophical traditions. The five-stanza (stotra-pañchaka) format reflects
  a classical Sanskrit poetic convention of concentrated devotional expression.
