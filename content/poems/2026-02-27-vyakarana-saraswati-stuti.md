title: व्याकरणरूप वाग्देवता स्तुतिः

abstract: A devotional hymn in Sanskrit verse that personifies grammar (vyākaraṇa)
  as a form of the goddess Vāg Devī (the Goddess of Speech). The poem celebrates the
  generative power of grammatical rules and word-formation, demonstrating how the
  systematic application of morphological principles creates semantic unity and multiplicity
  simultaneously, thereby revealing grammar as a divine manifestation.
preamble: This work participates in the Sanskrit philosophical and devotional tradition
  that locates divinity within language itself. Following the Pāṇinian grammatical
  school and the metaphysical vision of Advaita Vedānta, the poem treats vyākaraṇa
  (Sanskrit grammar) as an expression of Vāg Devī—the goddess of speech who presides
  over linguistic creation. This hymnic composition exemplifies the Indian scholarly
  practice of rendering technical disciplines as objects of philosophical and spiritual
  contemplation, elevating grammatical analysis to the status of spiritual practice
  (sādhana).
