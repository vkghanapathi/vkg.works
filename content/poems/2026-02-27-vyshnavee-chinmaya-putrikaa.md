abstract: A devotional verse (āśīḥ, benediction) composed in Telugu by Dr. Vamshi
  Krishna Ghanapāṭhī, invoking divine blessing through the figure of Lakṣmī (Vaiṣṇavī)
  upon a girl of Śāṇḍilya lineage. The poem interweaves Vedantic symbolism—water as
  knowledge, the lotus as enlightenment—with household dharma and filial obedience,
  presenting spiritual welfare as inseparable from learned conduct and reverence toward
  elders.
preamble: This work belongs to the Telugu devotional poetry tradition, specifically
  the genre of benedictory verses (āśīrvādas) common in Vaiṣṇava households and life-cycle
  rituals. The Śāṇḍilya lineage is a distinguished Brahminical clan known for its
  transmission of Vedantic knowledge and spiritual discipline within the Vedic dharmic
  system. The invocation of Vaiṣṇavī—the śakti or active power of Viṣṇu, identified
  with Lakṣmī—reflects the broader Hindu theological framework wherein prosperity,
  wisdom, and household well-being flow from divine grace and are secured through
  ethical conduct, guru-seva (service to teachers), and adherence to vedic tradition.
