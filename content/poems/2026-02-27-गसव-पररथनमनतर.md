title: गोसेवा प्रार्थनमन्त्राः

abstract: A devotional prayer-hymn sequence comprising eight verses dedicated to cow
  veneration (gosevā), composed in Sanskrit. Each verse invokes the cow as Kāmadhenu
  (the wish-fulfilling divine cow) and a bestower of blessings, presenting her multifaceted
  roles in Vedic sacrifice, sustenance, and spiritual welfare, concluding with a repeated
  refrain requesting divine grace and protection.
preamble: This work belongs to the Hindu devotional literature tradition emphasizing
  the sanctity of cows in Vedic cosmology and ritual practice. The cow holds a central
  position in Indian dharma as both a material provider of nourishment and a conduit
  for spiritual merit. This sequence of prayers draws on classical Sanskrit conventions
  of stotras and prārthanās (praises and supplications), invoking Kāmadhenu—the mythological
  celestial cow—as an intermediary to secure material prosperity, ancestral satisfaction,
  and moral protection. The work reflects a synthesis of Vedic ritualism (evident
  in references to agnihotra and abhiṣeka) with devotional practice (bhakti) addressed
  to the living cow as a manifestation of the divine.
