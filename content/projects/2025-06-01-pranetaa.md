excerpt: "Pranetaa is an end-to-end digital publishing workflow for Vedic and Sanskrit scholarship — from manuscript to DOI-registered open-access article in a single pipeline."
abstract: "Pranetaa (Sanskrit: प्रणेता, the Guide) is a purpose-built scholarly publishing platform designed for Vedic and Sanskrit academic works. It automates the full editorial pipeline — document ingestion, text extraction, AI-assisted abstract generation, editorial review, PDF compilation, Zenodo deposit with DOI assignment, and simultaneous publication to vkg.works — enabling a single scholar to manage the complete lifecycle of an academic publication."
preamble: "Built by Veda Vijnaana Vishtara as an internal publishing instrument, Pranetaa bridges the gap between traditional manuscript scholarship and modern open-access academic publishing standards."

## What Pranetaa Does

Pranetaa handles the complete lifecycle of a scholarly publication in six stages:

**1. Submission** — Accepts manuscripts in `.docx`, `.doc`, `.pdf`, `.pptx`, `.xlsx`, and `.html` formats. Scholars upload directly through the web interface.

**2. Text Extraction** — Automatically extracts the full text from uploaded documents, preserving Devanagari, Telugu, and Kannada scripts, including VijayaDV PUA-encoded characters.

**3. AI Processing** — Uses Claude (Anthropic) to generate a structured academic abstract, a contextual preamble, and a keyword list — calibrated specifically for Vedic and Sanskrit scholarship. No content is altered; only presentation metadata is created.

**4. Editorial Review** — The scholar reviews, edits, and approves the AI-generated metadata. The work is assigned to a section and category on vkg.works.

**5. DOI Registration via Zenodo** — Upon publish, the document is converted to PDF and deposited to Zenodo under open-access Creative Commons CC-BY licence. A permanent DOI is assigned with full author metadata including ORCID.

**6. Publication** — The article simultaneously appears on [vkg.works](https://vkg.works) with its DOI, abstract, preamble, and keywords — fully indexed and RSS-syndicated.

## Author Metadata

All publications carry the verified author record:

- **Name:** Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapathi
- **Affiliation:** Veda Vijnaana Vishtara
- **ORCID:** [0009-0007-3852-0158](https://orcid.org/0009-0007-3852-0158)
- **Role:** Project Leader

## Technical Architecture

Pranetaa is built on a modern, cloud-native stack:

- **Backend:** Python (FastAPI), deployed on Google Cloud Run (Mumbai region)
- **Frontend:** TypeScript (Next.js), PWA-capable with offline support
- **Mobile:** Flutter (Dart), for on-the-go editorial review
- **AI:** Claude Sonnet / Haiku (Anthropic API)
- **Storage:** SQLite with GCS bucket persistence; uploaded files on Cloud Storage
- **DOI:** Zenodo REST API with automatic PDF upload
- **Publishing bridge:** GitHub API pushes directly to vkg.works repository on publish

## Connection to vkg.works

Every article published through Pranetaa automatically appears on vkg.works. The publishing bridge commits a structured Markdown file to the vkg.works GitHub repository, which triggers a GitHub Actions build and FTP deployment — making the article live within minutes.

Pranetaa and vkg.works share aligned purpose: to make Vedic scholarship permanently accessible, citable, and open.
