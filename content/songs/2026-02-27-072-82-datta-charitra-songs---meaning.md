abstract: A collection of twelve devotional kirtanas (sung compositions) in classical
  Carnatic music idiom, dedicated to Lord Dattatreya and composed by Sri Ganesha Sachchidananda
  Swami of the Avdhoot Dattapeeth monastery in Mysore. Each composition employs specific
  ragas and talas while integrating Sanskrit philosophical content with narrative
  elements from the Datta Charitra (life of Lord Dattatreya), serving both as musical
  performances and vehicles for spiritual instruction within the Datta tradition.
preamble: This work belongs to the devotional music tradition of the Datta Sampradaya,
  a Hindu monastic lineage that venerates Lord Dattatreya—understood as an incarnation
  of the Trimurti (Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva)—as the supreme Guru. The kirtana format
  represents a synthesis of Carnatic classical music with Vedantic philosophy and
  mythological narratives, functioning as a form of saguna bhakti (devotion with form)
  combined with jnana (wisdom) instruction. The compositions are grounded in Sanskrit
  metres, Vedic mantras, and tantric philosophy (particularly references to chakras
  and kundalini), making them significant documents of how medieval Hindu devotional
  practice integrated musical, scriptural, and yogic elements within a monastic teaching
  context.
