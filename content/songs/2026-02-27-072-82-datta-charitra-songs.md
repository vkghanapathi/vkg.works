abstract: A structured table of contents and musical notation index for devotional
  songs (kīrtanas) composed in praise of Dattātreya, the Vedic guru-deity venerated
  across Hindu traditions. The work catalogues eleven primary kīrtanas and a closing
  benedictory song, each specified with rāga (melodic mode), tāla (rhythmic cycle),
  and thematic content drawn from Dattātreya's mythological narrative, including his
  birth, childhood exploits, and spiritual teachings.
preamble: This work belongs to the bhakti music tradition of South Indian Carnatic
  classical music, specifically devotional compositions dedicated to Dattātreya—a
  Vedic avaraṇa (incarnation) recognized as the embodiment of the Trimūrti (Brahma,
  Viṣṇu, and Śiva) and revered as the supreme guru-principle in Advaita Vedānta and
  Nātha sampradāya philosophy. The kīrtana form, popularized by composers such as
  Tyāgarāja, combines Sanskrit poetic texts with classical musical structures to convey
  philosophical and devotional content. This indexed compilation preserves both the
  liturgical sequence and the precise musical specifications necessary for performance,
  serving as both a musicological reference and a devotional primer.
