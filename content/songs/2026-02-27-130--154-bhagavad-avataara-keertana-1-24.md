title: 0 హరి రవ తతార (చతురస్ర)

status: draft
abstract: A Telugu devotional song cycle by Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī centered
  on the ten avatars (incarnations) of Viṣṇu, with a prefatory invocation ('Hari Rava
  Tatār'). Each avatar is rendered in classical metres (chaturasra, trisragati, khaṇḍagati,
  miśra gati) characteristic of Carnatic music notation, combining Vedic liturgical
  forms with bhakti devotionalism.
preamble: This work belongs to the tradition of Viṣṇu-centered Hindu devotional literature,
  drawing on the Bhāgavata Purāṇa's account of divine incarnations. The song collection
  employs the classical metres and Sanskrit-Telugu hybrid vocabulary typical of South
  Indian temple music and philosophical exposition. Each avatar—from the Boar (Varāha)
  through Buddha and Kalkī—is presented as a revelation of the absolute consciousness
  (Sat-Chit-Ānanda), combining narrative devotion with non-dual philosophical teaching
  (Advaita) characteristic of Vedānta and Sāṃkhya traditions.
