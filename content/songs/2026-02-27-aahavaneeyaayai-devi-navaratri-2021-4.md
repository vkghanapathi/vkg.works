title: నవరాత్రి 21.4 (నమస్కారము)
date: '2026-02-27'

status: draft
abstract: A devotional hymn from Dr. Vamshi Krishna's Navaratri song cycle (section
  21.4), structured as a namaskāra (invocation) to Durgā Devī in her multiple cosmic
  forms. The work combines ritualistic invocation with detailed philosophical commentary
  (bhāvārtha) explaining the Vedic and Upaniṣadic foundations of goddess worship,
  particularly the symbolism of Āhavanīya (the sacrificial fire altar) and the dual
  nature of knowledge (vidyā).
preamble: This composition belongs to the Śaradanavaratri (autumnal nine-nights) observance
  within the Vedic ritual calendar, specifically referenced within the Chāturmāsya
  (four-month vow period from Āṣāḍha to Kārtika). The work draws extensively on Upaniṣadic
  philosophy, particularly the Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad's distinction between aparavidyā (lower
  knowledge) and paravidyā (supreme knowledge), while grounding worship in the Vedic
  yajña (sacrifice) tradition and the threefold Vedic fire altars. The commentary
  integrates Śāntrika (peace-oriented), Śākta (goddess-centered), and Advaitic philosophical
  frameworks.
