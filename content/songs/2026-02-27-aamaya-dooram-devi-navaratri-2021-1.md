abstract: A devotional prayer in Telugu addressing Goddess Durga, invoking her protection
  from disease, suffering, and moral corruption. The work combines a metrical song
  structure (pallavi-anupallavi form) with detailed Sanskrit and Telugu commentary,
  presenting both the liturgical text and its philosophical interpretation regarding
  physical ailment (vyadhi), mental distress (adhi), and the cultivation of virtue
  through divine grace.
preamble: This piece belongs to the Navaratri song cycle of Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī,
  situating itself within the Hindu devotional tradition of Durga worship during the
  nine-night Navaratri festival. Durga, understood as the supreme goddess who destroys
  evil and protects devotees, is invoked here not merely for physical healing but
  for moral and spiritual transformation. The work exemplifies the South Indian practice
  of combining Sanskrit devotional formulae with vernacular Telugu exegesis, making
  sacred knowledge accessible while maintaining classical pedagogical methods rooted
  in Vedic commentary traditions.
