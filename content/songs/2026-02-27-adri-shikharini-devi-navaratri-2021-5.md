title: నవరాత్రి 21.5 (ప్రార్థన)
date: '2026-02-27'
author: Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī
status: draft
abstract: A devotional hymn to Durgā composed in Telugu, structured as three stanzas
  of alliterative Sanskrit verse with extensive vernacular commentary. The work praises
  the goddess's cosmic powers—her dwelling in mountain peaks, her consort relationship
  with Śiva, her victory over demons, her bestowal of spiritual siddhis (perfected
  powers), and her role as the ultimate source of dharma and liberation.
preamble: This work belongs to the Navratri devotional literature tradition, specifically
  a prayer (prārthanā) composed for recitation during the nine-day festival honoring
  the goddess Durgā. The piece employs classical Sanskrit alliterative poetics (anuprāsa)
  while being contextualized through Telugu exegesis, a characteristic method of Dr.
  Vamshi Krishna's scholarly presentation. The commentary explicates Vedantic concepts
  of pure consciousness (śuddha chaitanya), the fourfold discipline of spiritual practice
  (sādhana-chatuṣṭaya), and the goddess's role as both cosmic mother and supreme liberator
  within Hindu devotional theology.
