abstract: This work presents a collection of devotional songs (bhajans or kirtanas)
  compiled and possibly composed by Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī. The songs represent
  an important category of vernacular religious literature designed for congregational
  singing and worship within Hindu devotional traditions.
preamble: Devotional songs occupy a central place in Hindu worship practices, particularly
  within the bhakti movements that have flourished across South India since the medieval
  period. These compositions, whether addressed to Śiva, Viṣṇu, or other deities,
  serve as vehicles for expressing religious emotion, transmitting theological concepts,
  and facilitating collective spiritual experience. Dr. Ghanapāṭhī's compilation represents
  a modern scholarly engagement with this living tradition, preserving and making
  accessible songs that bridge classical and contemporary devotional practice.
