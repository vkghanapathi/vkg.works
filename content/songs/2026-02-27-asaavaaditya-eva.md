abstract: A devotional song sequence exploring the feminine divine principle (Śakti)
  across the three daily ritual periods of Sandhyāvandana (dawn, noon, and dusk worship).
  The work connects each temporal phase to distinct manifestations of the Goddess—Brahmī
  and Gāyatrī at dawn, Sāvitrī and Ruddrī at midday, and Vaiṣṇavī and Sarasvatī at
  dusk—within a framework of Vedic solar worship (Sāvitra-upāsanā) and ritual propitiation.
preamble: This composition belongs to the liturgical-devotional tradition of Sandhyāvandana,
  the prescribed daily twilight and noon worship ritual rooted in Vedic Brahmanism
  and continuing through classical Hindu practice. The work integrates Vedic solar
  theology (worship of Sūrya/Savitṛ) with tantric conceptions of cosmic feminine energy,
  demonstrating how the single divine Śakti assumes multiple forms corresponding to
  the diurnal rhythm of ritual observance. The text reflects a learned theological
  synthesis characteristic of pre-modern Sanskrit and Telugu devotional scholarship.
