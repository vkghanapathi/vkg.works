title: "tālapravāhaḥ 3.1 - \taṭatālam – tisrajātiḥ \tmalahari rāgaḥ"
date: '2026-02-27'

status: draft
abstract: A devotional composition in Malahari rāga set to āṭa tāla with tisrajāti
  rhythmic structure, demonstrating the integration of musical notation with Sanskrit
  devotional poetry. The work presents a structured three-part song form (pallavi,
  anupallavi, caraṇam) focused on guru sevā (service to the spiritual teacher) as
  a daily spiritual discipline, accompanied by notated melodic passages and explicit
  philosophical commentary in Sanskrit and English.
preamble: This composition belongs to the Carnatic music tradition of South Indian
  classical music, specifically exemplifying the kīrtana form that synthesizes rāga
  (melodic framework), tāla (rhythmic cycle), and devotional Telugu or Sanskrit text.
  The work emphasizes the Vedantic principle of guru-śiṣya paramparā (teacher-student
  lineage) central to Hindu spiritual practice, presenting guru sevā not merely as
  ritual obligation but as a path to mokṣa (liberation) and divine grace. The explicit
  bilingual commentary (Sanskrit and English) suggests this composition functions
  as both a performable liturgical piece and an educational text for contemporary
  practitioners unfamiliar with classical Sanskrit philosophical vocabulary.
