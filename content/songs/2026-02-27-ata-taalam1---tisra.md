abstract: This composition in Mālahari rāga set to Aṭatāla in tisra-jāti presents
  a devotional song structured in pallavi-anupallavi-caraṇa form with elaborate sāraṇgati
  (melodic notation) and rhythmic specifications. The work celebrates guru-sevā (discipleship
  and service to the preceptor) as the path to liberation and spiritual attainment,
  employing traditional Carnatic music pedagogical and devotional idioms.
preamble: Tālapravāhaḥ represents a systematic collection of compositions rooted in
  the South Indian Carnatic music tradition, which integrates Vedic chanting practices
  with classical rāga-tāla frameworks. This particular entry exemplifies the devotional-pedagogical
  strain of Sanskrit music composition, wherein the guru-śiṣya (teacher-student) relationship
  constitutes both the thematic focus and the living transmission mode of the tradition
  itself. The melodic grammar of Mālahari rāga, paired with the ten-beat Aṭatāla cycle,
  provides the structural container for ethical and metaphysical instruction drawn
  from Hindu monastic and philosophical lineages, particularly Advaita Vedānta thought.
