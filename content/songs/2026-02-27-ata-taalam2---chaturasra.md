author: Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī
status: draft
abstract: This is a complete musical composition (kriti) in Bilhari raga, set in Ata
  tala with Chaturasra jati metre. The work exemplifies Dr. Vamshi Krishna's systematic
  approach to Carnatic music pedagogy through his Tālapravāha series, presenting a
  full three-section song structure (pallavi, anupallavi, charana) with detailed solkattu
  notation. The composition uses the metaphor of divine sport (līlā) to explore theological
  concepts of creation, karma, and the cyclical nature of birth and rebirth.
preamble: This composition belongs to the Carnatic classical music tradition of South
  India and reflects the devotional-philosophical framework of Vedantic thought. The
  work invokes the concept of divine play (Brahmā-līlā) wherein the Supreme Creator
  engages in the sport of creation, preservation, and dissolution of the universe.
  Set within the pedagogical framework of the Tālapravāha series—a systematic exploration
  of tala and jati combinations—this kriti integrates musical technique with metaphysical
  doctrine, a characteristic feature of the bhakti-aligned Carnatic song tradition.
