abstract: A devotional song (gīta) in Telugu dedicated to Hayagrīva, the horse-headed
  avatāra of Viṣṇu, composed in mixed metre (miśra gati). The work praises Hayagrīva
  as the embodiment of Vedic knowledge and the presiding deity of sacrificial ritual,
  employing elaborate Sanskrit nomenclature and Vedantic imagery to establish the
  deity's supreme role in maintaining cosmic order through yajña (ritual action).
preamble: This composition belongs to the classical devotional song tradition of Śaiva
  and Vaiṣṇava worship in Telugu literature. Hayagrīva holds a unique place in Hindu
  theology as the horse-headed incarnation of Viṣṇu, traditionally associated with
  the recovery of the Vedas from cosmic dissolution and with the protection of sacred
  knowledge. The work situates itself within the broader liturgical context of yajña-centred
  worship, drawing upon Upaniṣadic philosophy and Vedantic metaphysics to articulate
  the relationship between ritual, cosmic manifestation, and divine consciousness.
