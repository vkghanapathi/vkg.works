abstract: A devotional song (gatika) in chaturasra tala (four-beat metre) honouring
  Visnu in his Matsya (Fish) and Hayagriva (Horse-headed) avatars. The composition
  interweaves Puranic narrative—Matsya's rescue of the Vedas from the demon Hayagriva—with
  philosophical devotion, invoking divine protection through knowledge and liberation
  from samsara.
preamble: This work belongs to the South Indian devotional song tradition (kirtana),
  specifically composed in classical metres aligned with Vedantic philosophy and Vaishnava
  bhakti practice. The Matsya and Hayagriva avatars are central to the Vaishnava theological
  understanding of divine descent (avatara) to preserve cosmic order and sacred knowledge.
  The song structure follows the pallavi-charana-anustup form, a standard framework
  in classical Telugu devotional music, allowing for both narrative elaboration and
  philosophical reflection on the nature of divine grace and cosmic salvation.
