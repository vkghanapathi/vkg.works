title: 12) కూర్మ (తిస్ర గతి)
date: '2026-02-27'
author: Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī
status: draft
abstract: A devotional song sequence dedicated to Kūrma, the tortoise avatāra of Viṣṇu,
  composed in multiple metres (pallavi, caraṇa, anuṣṭup). The work celebrates Kūrma's
  pivotal role in the churning of the ocean of milk (kṣīrsamanthan), wherein the deity
  sustains Mount Mandara on his back to enable the recovery of divine nectar by gods
  and demons. Through lyrical invocation and philosophical reflection, the composition
  interweaves cosmological narrative with meditative praise, exploring themes of divine
  forbearance, non-dual consciousness (sat-chit-ānanda), and the transcendence of
  guṇas.
preamble: This work belongs to the devotional music tradition of Telugu Vedāntic composition,
  rooted in the Vaiṣṇava theology of the Purāṇas and Upaniṣadic philosophy. The Kūrma
  Avatāra, celebrated in the Viṣṇu Purāṇa and Bhāgavata Purāṇa, represents Viṣṇu's
  manifestation as cosmic support and patient sustainer. Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī's
  presentation situates this mythological event within a framework of philosophical
  inquiry into divine attributes, the interplay of prakṛti's qualities, and the aspirant's
  path to non-dual realization (mokṣa). The 'tisra gati' (triple metre) designation
  indicates rhythmic complexity aligned with classical Carnatic musical aesthetics.
