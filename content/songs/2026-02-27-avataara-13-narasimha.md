abstract: A devotional song (padya) in Telugu addressed to Narasimha, the Man-Lion
  avatar of Vishnu, celebrating his role as protector of the devotee Prahlada and
  destroyer of the demon Hiranyakashipu. The composition employs the khanda gati (broken/irregular
  meter) form and combines multiple metrical patterns (pallavi, anu-pallavi, charana,
  and anushtup) to create a rhythmically complex devotional hymn emphasizing both
  the fierce and graceful aspects of the deity.
preamble: This work belongs to the South Indian classical devotional music and poetry
  tradition (bhakti padya), specifically addressing Narasimha, one of the ten principal
  avatars (dashavatara) of Vishnu in Hindu theology. Narasimha occupies a central
  place in Vaishnava devotional literature and Puranic narrative, particularly in
  the Bhagavata Purana's account of his manifestation to protect the young devotee
  Prahlada from his demoniac father Hiranyakashipu. The khanda gati compositional
  style reflects sophisticated prosodic techniques developed in medieval Telugu literary
  traditions and continues to be performed in concert and devotional contexts.
