title: 14) చక్రపాణి గజేంద్ర మోచక (తిస్ర గతి)

abstract: A devotional song in three metres (trisra gati) depicting Lord Viṣṇu's rescue
  of the elephant Gajendra from the crocodile's grip. The composition employs narrative
  imagery from the Bhāgavata Purāṇa's celebrated Gajendra-mokṣa episode, interweaving
  philosophical reflection on bondage and liberation with direct invocation of divine
  grace and compassion.
preamble: This work belongs to the Telugu devotional song tradition (kīrtana) and
  draws from the Bhāgavata Purāṇa (Book 8), one of Hinduism's most cherished narrative
  texts. The Gajendra-mokṣa narrative—the deliverance of an elephant-king besieged
  by a crocodile—serves as an allegory for the soul's entrapment in sensory desire
  and its liberation through surrender to Viṣṇu. The composer invokes the Chakrapāṇi
  (disc-bearing) form of Viṣṇu, situating this hymn within the Vaiṣṇava devotional
  continuum while maintaining the technical sophistication of classical song composition.
