abstract: A devotional lyric composition honouring Viṣṇu in his Vāmana (dwarf) incarnation,
  structured in the classical song format with pallavi (refrain), caraṇam (stanza),
  and anuṣṭubh metre. The work celebrates Viṣṇu's cosmic stride (vikramaṇa) that encompassed
  the three worlds and his subjugation of the demon king Bali, emphasizing the theme
  of divine grace bestowed through the sanctity of the deity's feet.
preamble: This composition participates in the Sanskrit devotional music tradition
  of South India, specifically in the iconography of the Trivikrama or Vāmana avatāra—the
  fifth incarnation of Viṣṇu recorded in the Vaiṣṇava Purāṇas. The Vāmana narrative,
  wherein Viṣṇu assumes a dwarf form to recover the three worlds from the asura Bali
  through his famous three-step stride, exemplifies the Vedantic concept of divine
  omnipresence concealed within apparent limitation. This work invokes Viṣṇu as the
  protector deity of the cosmos and emphasizes his transcendent nature (sat-cit-ānanda)
  accessible through devotional surrender and ritual veneration of his sacred feet.
