abstract: A devotional song in Telugu celebrating Nārada as the exemplary bhakta (devotee)
  who received divine wisdom from Viṣṇu in the form of a Haṃsa (swan/divine teacher).
  The work invokes the grace of this swan-embodied deity across five verses, employing
  the tripartite song structure (pallavi, anupallavi) to request spiritual liberation,
  purification of afflictions, and realization of non-dual truth (tattva). This composition
  exemplifies the Bhāgavata tradition's integration of Vedantic philosophy with devotional
  practice.
preamble: This work belongs to the Bhāgavata Purana devotional lineage, which emphasizes
  Nārada as the archetypal sage-devotee and transmitter of divine knowledge. In Hindu
  philosophical theology, Viṣṇu's manifestation as Haṃsa (the transcendent swan) signifies
  the paramātman (supreme self) guiding seekers toward mokṣa (liberation). The invocation
  of Nārada alongside Śuka and Parāśara—foundational teachers in the Bhāgavata tradition—situates
  this song within a guru-śiṣya (teacher-disciple) lineage. The three-gati (three
  rhythmic patterns) structure indicates this is a sophisticated devotional hymn composed
  for recitation or performance in religious contexts.
