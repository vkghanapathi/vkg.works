abstract: A devotional composition in Telugu celebrating Viṣṇu as the protector and
  sustainer of the Manu lineage across successive cosmic ages (manvantaras). The work
  employs classical Sanskrit metrical patterns (Pallavi in Catusṛ Gati and concluding
  Anuṣṭup) to articulate the divine dharma upheld by Viṣṇu through successive incarnations,
  emphasizing his role in maintaining cosmic order, destroying the wicked, and conferring
  peace and bliss upon the virtuous.
preamble: This composition participates in the Bhakti tradition's theological elaboration
  of Viṣṇu's role as Puruṣottama and upholder of dharma across the yugas and manvantaras
  described in Puranic cosmology. The work integrates Sanskrit devotional conventions
  with Telugu composition, drawing on foundational Vedic and Smṛti concepts of dharma-pālana
  (protection of righteous order) and the Viṣṇuite theology of divine descent and
  cosmic protection. The metrical sophistication and invocation structure align with
  the disciplined devotional practice (bhakti) cultivated in medieval South Indian
  temple and scholarly traditions.
