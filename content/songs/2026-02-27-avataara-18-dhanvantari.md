title: 18) ధన్వంతరి (మిశ్ర గతి)

abstract: A devotional song in mixed metrical form (miśra gati) dedicated to Dhanvantari,
  the Vedic physician-deity and avatar of Viṣṇu. The composition praises Dhanvantari
  as the divine healer who cures disease, conquers the three afflictions (tāpa-traya),
  and grants longevity through Āyurveda, culminating in a formal benedictory verse
  in Anuṣṭubh meter.
preamble: 'This work belongs to the South Indian devotional music tradition (kīrtana),
  specifically addressing Dhanvantari within the Vaiṣṇava theological framework. Dhanvantari
  holds dual significance: he appears in Vedic mythology as the physician who emerged
  during the churning of the cosmic ocean bearing divine medicine (amṛta), and he
  is venerated as the founder and presiding deity of Āyurveda (the classical Indian
  system of medicine). The song integrates medical philosophy with bhakti (devotional
  surrender), presenting healing as a grace extended through both empirical knowledge
  and divine compassion.'
