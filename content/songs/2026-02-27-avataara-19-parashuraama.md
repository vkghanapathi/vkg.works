title: 19) పరశురామ (చతురస్ర గతి)

status: draft
abstract: A devotional composition in Telugu honouring Paraśurāma, the sixth avatar
  of Viṣṇu, celebrated for his martial prowess and destruction of tyrannical kings.
  The work combines the Pallavi form (lyric verse) with Anuṣṭup meter (classical Sanskrit
  prosody), emphasizing Paraśurāma's role as divine enforcer of dharma and his lineage
  as son of Jamadagni.
preamble: This composition belongs to the devotional lyric tradition (bhakti gīta)
  of Telugu literature, drawing on the Purāṇic narrative of Paraśurāma found in texts
  such as the Viṣṇu Purāṇa and Mahābhārata. Paraśurāma occupies a central place in
  Hindu cosmology as one of the Daśāvatāras (ten principal incarnations of Viṣṇu),
  distinguished by his warrior asceticism and his twenty-one campaigns against the
  Kṣatriya kings (Haihayas) who had strayed from dharmic rule. The invocation integrates
  scriptural devotion with musical-poetic structure, making it suitable for temple
  recitation or musical performance within the Carnatic classical tradition.
