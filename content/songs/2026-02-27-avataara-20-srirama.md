title: 20) రామ (మిశ్ర గతి)
date: '2026-02-27'

abstract: A devotional song in misra gati (mixed rhythmic meter) dedicated to Rāma
  Chandra, structured in the classical kīrtana form with pallavi, anupallavi, and
  charaṇa sections. The composition celebrates Rāma's divine attributes across key
  episodes of the Rāmāyaṇa narrative—his birth as Daśaratha's son, his exile to the
  forest, his victory over demons, his alliance with Hanumān, the construction of
  the bridge to Laṅkā, and his final victory over Rāvaṇa—culminating in a Sanskrit
  anuṣṭup verse invoking Rāma as Viṣṇu and the sun of the Ikṣvāku dynasty.
preamble: This work belongs to the Sanskrit kīrtana tradition of Hindu devotional
  music, a practice deeply rooted in the bhakti movement and formalized within classical
  Indian music theory. Kīrtanas are lyrical compositions set to melodic rāgas and
  rhythmic patterns (tālas), designed for congregational singing and private meditation.
  The Rāma kīrtana is particularly significant as it encodes theological and narrative
  content from the Rāmāyaṇa—one of Hinduism's foundational epics—within a musically
  accessible form, allowing practitioners to internalize both the story and the spiritual
  significance of Rāma's avatāra. The inclusion of a Sanskrit verse (anuṣṭup) at the
  end anchors the devotional utterance in scriptural authority.
