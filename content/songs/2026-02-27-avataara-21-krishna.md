title: 21) కృష్ణ (తిస్ర గతి)
date: '2026-02-27'
author: Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī
status: draft
abstract: A devotional composition in Telugu honouring Krishna across three metrical
  registers (pallavi, charanas in anushtubh metre). The work traces Krishna's divine
  biography from his birth through his cosmic manifestations, emphasizing his role
  as world-teacher (lokaguru) and embodiment of Brahman consciousness (sacchidananda).
  This piece exemplifies the Krishna-focused bhakti tradition within Vedic-Puranic
  theological frameworks.
preamble: This composition belongs to the devotional song tradition (samkirtana) within
  Hindu bhakti practice, drawing from classical Puranic narratives of Krishna's life—particularly
  the Bhagavata Purana. The work follows the compositional structure of Carnatic classical
  music, with a pallavi (refrain) and multiple charana (stanzas) sections, a format
  widely adopted in South Indian devotional literature. Krishna is invoked here not
  merely as a historical figure but as Vishnu incarnate, the supreme consciousness
  whose teachings (embodied in the Bhagavad Gita) constitute the essence of dharma.
  The final verse in anushtubh metre (the classical Sanskrit meter of epic poetry)
  anchors this Telugu composition within the Sanskrit-Puranic textual genealogy.
