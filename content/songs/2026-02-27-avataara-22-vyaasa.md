abstract: A devotional song in mixed meter (miśra gati) composed in Telugu, celebrating
  Vyāsa (Bādarāyaṇa), the legendary compiler of the Vedas and author of the Brahma
  Sutras. The work praises Vyāsa's comprehensive literary and philosophical contributions—encompassing
  the Vedas, Purāṇas, Itihāsas, and Upaniṣadic teachings—while invoking his grace
  to elevate human souls of limited lifespan and understanding toward the eternal
  bliss of brahman.
preamble: This composition belongs to the devotional song tradition (kīrtana/padya)
  within Hindu philosophical practice, specifically honoring Vyāsa as a deified sage-author
  central to Vedānta and Smṛti traditions. Vyāsa, identified with the god Viṣṇu in
  avatāric theology, is revered as the systematizer of sacred knowledge and the architect
  of the fourfold Veda, the eighteen Purāṇas, the Mahābhārata, and the foundational
  philosophical aphorisms of the Brahma Sutras. The song's invocation and closing
  benediction reflect a broader ritual and meditative practice of worshipping the
  great ṛṣis as embodiments of divine wisdom and salvific grace.
