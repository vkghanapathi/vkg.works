abstract: A devotional composition in Telugu honouring Buddha as a spiritual teacher
  and embodiment of dharma, structured in classical song form with pallavi, charana,
  and anushtup verse sections. The work develops Buddhist philosophical themes—particularly
  the rejection of ritual sacrifice and the doctrine of emptiness—while framing Buddha
  within a Hindu devotional framework, addressing him as a manifestation of Vishnu
  and celebrating his teachings on compassion and the illusory nature of phenomenal
  existence.
preamble: This composition belongs to the bhakti poetic tradition of South India,
  wherein classical Hindu devotional modes are extended to encompass Buddhist philosophical
  content. The work exemplifies a syncretic approach common in medieval Telugu literature,
  where Buddha is incorporated into the Vaishnava theological system as an avatara
  of Vishnu—a doctrinal position articulated in the Bhagavata Purana and elsewhere
  in Hindu philosophical literature. The song format (pallavi-charana structure with
  concluding anushtup verses) is characteristic of Carnatic music-poetry and allows
  the systematic exposition of dharmic teachings through lyrical repetition and thematic
  variation, linking Buddhist ethical philosophy with the devotional aesthetics of
  the bhakti movement.
