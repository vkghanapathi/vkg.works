abstract: A devotional song cycle in Telugu invoking Kalki, the anticipated final
  avatar of Viṣṇu in Hindu eschatology, to remedy the moral and religious degradation
  of the Kali age. The composition employs classical poetic metres (pallavi, caraṇa,
  anusṭubh) and theological discourse to petition the divine for restoration of dharma,
  the removal of societal corruption, and the grace of righteous understanding.
preamble: This work belongs to the Bhakti-Vedānta devotional tradition, drawing upon
  Purāṇic narratives of the Daśāvatāra (ten avatars of Viṣṇu) and Vaiṣṇava eschatology.
  The Kalki avatar represents the ultimate divine intervention at the conclusion of
  the Kali Yuga (age of spiritual darkness), when cosmic order has collapsed and ethical
  frameworks have disintegrated. The song addresses Kalki as the sole remedy for universal
  disorder, invoking him to annihilate evil (adharma), restore sacrificial rites,
  and re-establish moral governance. This theological framework resonates with classical
  Sanskrit sources such as the Bhāgavata Purāṇa and Viṣṇu Purāṇa, here articulated
  in Telugu vernacular verse.
