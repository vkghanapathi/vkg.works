title: 6) నర నారాయణ దేవతే (చతురస్ర

abstract: A devotional song (kriti) in Telugu honouring the divine pair Nara and Narayana,
  ascetic deities associated with dharma and spiritual discipline. The composition
  employs multiple metrical forms (pallavi, charana, and anushtup verse) to celebrate
  their exemplary renunciation of desire and anger, their dwelling at Badrinath shrine,
  and their transcendence of worldly affliction.
preamble: This work belongs to the kirtana tradition of Telugu devotional music, which
  flourishes within Hindu bhakti practices. Nara and Narayana are venerated in Vaishnava
  theology as eternal companions representing the ideal of detached devotion; they
  are traditionally associated with Badrinath (Badarikashrama), a sacred pilgrimage
  site in the Himalayas. The song's focus on their conquest of kama (desire) and krodha
  (anger)—cardinal obstacles in Hindu ethical philosophy—situates the composition
  within dharma-centred devotionalism, emphasizing ascetic virtue alongside divine
  grace.
