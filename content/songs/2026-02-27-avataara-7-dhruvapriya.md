title: "7.ధ్రువప్రియా\tవాసుదేవ (తిస్రగతి)"
date: '2026-02-27'
author: Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī
status: draft
abstract: A devotional song in Telugu honouring Vāsudev (Krishna) as the beloved of
  Dhruva, the legendary child devotee. The composition weaves together the narrative
  of Dhruva's refuge in forest asceticism, his initiation into the twelve-syllable
  mantra by the sage Nārada, and his attainment of the supreme spiritual state (Dhruva-pada),
  presenting Krishna as the gracious bestower of liberation to the afflicted child
  abandoned by his stepmother's cruelty.
preamble: This work belongs to the tradition of Bhakti devotional poetry, specifically
  the Krishnaite devotional corpus within Hinduism. Dhruva is a central figure in
  the Bhāgavata Purāṇa, remembered as an exemplar of child devotion (bāla-bhakti)
  who, through rigorous ascetic practice and the guidance of Nārada, attains the eternal
  abode of Viṣṇu. The composition employs multiple metres (including Anushṭup) and
  lyrical forms (trisargati) characteristic of Telugu kīrtan and devotional song literature,
  addressing Krishna (Vāsudev) as the compassionate granter of Dhruva's ultimate spiritual
  achievement.
