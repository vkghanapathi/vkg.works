abstract: A devotional song (kriti) in khanda-gati (mixed metrical form) celebrating
  King Prithu as an avatar of Vishnu, composed by Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī. The
  work draws on the Puranic narrative of Prithu's miraculous birth from the body of
  King Vena and his role as establisher of dharma and protector of the earth, presenting
  him as a manifestation of the divine for the purpose of rectifying disorder and
  establishing righteous governance.
preamble: This composition belongs to the Carnatic music tradition of devotional vocal
  literature (kriti), which integrates Sanskrit philosophical and mythological content
  with melodic and rhythmic structures for performance in temple or concert contexts.
  The work draws from the Vishnu Purana and other Puranic sources that narrate Prithu's
  extraordinary genealogy and his function as a cosmic king (chakravartin) devoted
  to establishing social and moral order. The khanda-gati (irregular or mixed-meter)
  structure allows the composer to weave together multiple metrical patterns—including
  the traditional anuṣṭup (eight-syllable couplet)—reflecting both classical Sanskrit
  prosodic discipline and the compositional freedom characteristic of modern Carnatic
  devotional music.
