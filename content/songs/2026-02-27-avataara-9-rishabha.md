abstract: A devotional song (gīta) in Tiṣra Gati (triple time) dedicated to Ṛṣabha,
  the first Jina of Jainism, composed in Telugu using the pallavi-anupallavi-charaṇa
  song structure. The text celebrates Ṛṣabha's incarnation through King Agnīndhra
  and his spiritual attainment of Paramahansa Yoga, invoking his role as the exemplar
  of Yoga Rāja (King of Yoga) and Viṣṇu's manifestation.
preamble: This composition belongs to the tradition of Jain devotional poetry (bhakti
  gīta) composed in Telugu, a practice central to South Indian Jain spirituality.
  The work invokes Ṛṣabha (also known as Ādinātha), the first Tīrthaṅkara in Jain
  cosmology, revered as the supreme teacher and establisher of dharma. The song combines
  philosophical references to Yoga Rāja, Paramahansa Yoga, and Brahma-Kṣatra (spiritual
  kingship) with personal devotion, drawing on Jain scriptural narratives such as
  the Uttara Purāṇa where Ṛṣabha is described as the son of King Agnīndhra and Queen
  Sudevī. The meter (Anuṣṭup) and melodic framework (Tiṣra Gati) situate this work
  within classical South Indian musical-poetic conventions adapted for Jain ritual
  and devotional contexts.
