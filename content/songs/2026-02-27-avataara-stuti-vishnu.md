abstract: A devotional lyric composition in Telugu structured as a caturaśraya (four-fold
  metrical form), celebrating Hari (Viṣṇu) through invocatory verse and philosophical
  meditation. The work integrates Bhāgavata Purāṇa doctrine with devotional practice,
  culminating in an anuṣṭup verse that frames the divine avatāra lineage as a path
  to sachidānanda (existence-consciousness-bliss) realisation through bhakti.
preamble: This composition belongs to the Telugu devotional lyric tradition and draws
  directly from the Bhāgavata Purāṇa, foundational scripture of bhakti theology in
  Hindu practice. The work employs the caturaśraya (four-fold) metrical structure
  common to Andhran classical song composition, combining initial invocation (hariravatat-),
  thematic development through scriptural reference, and philosophical synthesis.
  The final anuṣṭup couplet anchors the piece in the Bhāgavata's discourse on divine
  descent (avatāra-paramparā) and locates devotional practice within the metaphysical
  framework of advaitin-informed non-dualism. This represents the intersection of
  Purāṇic textuality, Vedantic philosophy, and vernacular devotional expression characteristic
  of South Indian intellectual culture.
