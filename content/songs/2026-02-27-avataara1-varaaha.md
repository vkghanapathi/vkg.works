abstract: A devotional song in Telugu composed in Chaturasra meter (simple four-beat
  rhythm) dedicated to Varaha, the boar incarnation of Vishnu. The work invokes Varaha's
  divine form as saviour and protector, celebrating his role in rescuing the earth
  from demonic tyranny and sustaining all created beings, with elaborate metaphysical
  language connecting the deity's physical might to transcendent consciousness.
preamble: This composition belongs to the South Indian bhakti tradition of Vishnu
  devotion, specifically addressing Varaha—the divine boar avatar celebrated in Puranic
  mythology as the rescuer of the earth goddess (Prithvi) from the demon Hiranyaksha.
  The text invokes classical Sanskrit-Telugu hybrid poetic conventions characteristic
  of medieval South Indian temple liturgy, where devotional songs were performed as
  part of regular worship (puja) and festival celebrations. The inclusion of grammatical
  notation (Anushtup meter reference, Adadi-gana classification) reflects the scholarly
  precision valued in both Vedic chanting traditions and classical Sanskrit poetics
  adapted to vernacular Telugu composition.
