abstract: A devotional song sequence in Telugu honouring Yajña (Sacrifice) as a cosmic
  principle and manifestation of Viṣṇu. The composition employs classical Pallavi
  and Anusṭup meters to articulate the theology of ritual sacrifice as sustaining
  the cyclical renewal of life, vegetation, and divine order.
preamble: This work situates itself within the Vedic sacrificial tradition (yajña),
  a foundational practice in Hinduism wherein ritual action is understood as maintaining
  cosmic order (ṛta) and connecting the human, natural, and divine realms. The piece
  draws on the Upaniṣadic identification of Yajña with Viṣṇu (as stated in the Śatapathabrāhmaṇa
  and echoed in classical devotional theology) to articulate how sacrifice manifests
  as the generative force behind agricultural cycles, seasonal rhythms, and the perpetuation
  of life itself. By invoking Yajña as 'Yajñeśa' (Lord of Sacrifice) and identifying
  it with the eternal, conscious principle (sat-chit-ānanda), the song integrates
  Vedic ritualism with non-dualistic philosophy.
