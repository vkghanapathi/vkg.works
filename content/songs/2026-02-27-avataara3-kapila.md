title: 3. కపిల మునే (తిస్రగతి)
date: '2026-02-27'
author: Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī
status: draft
abstract: A devotional song in Telugu celebrating Kapila Muni, the legendary sage
  and founder of Sāṃkhya philosophy, as an incarnation of Viṣṇu who bestowed the knowledge
  of self-realization upon his mother Devahūti. The composition employs classical
  Sanskrit metrical forms (Pallavi, Caraṇa, and Anuṣṭup) to present Sāṃkhya-Yoga philosophy
  as the liberating path that dissolves worldly afflictions through discrimination
  between nature (prakṛti) and spirit (puruṣa).
preamble: This work belongs to the Bhakti devotional tradition of South India, specifically
  the practice of composing theological songs (kīrtanas) in regional languages with
  embedded Sanskrit philosophical content. The figure of Kapila occupies a central
  position in Hindu metaphysical thought as the author of the Sāṃkhya-Sūtra and the
  first teacher of Sāṃkhya philosophy. Within the Bhāgavata Purāṇa framework, Kapila
  is venerated as a divine descent (avatāra) of Viṣṇu, and the narrative of his instruction
  to Devahūti (the daughter of Manu and wife of Kardama) represents one of the most
  significant philosophical dialogues in Hindu scripture. Dr. Ghanapāṭhī's composition
  places this episode within a musical and liturgical context, making the abstract
  principles of Sāṃkhya accessible to devotional practitioners through song.
