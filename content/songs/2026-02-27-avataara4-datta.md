abstract: A devotional composition in Telugu honouring Dattatreya (Datta), the tri-form
  deity embodying Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva. The work comprises multiple metrical
  sections—pallavi, charana, and anushtup—celebrating Dattatreya's grace, his role
  in liberation from the cycle of birth and death, and his manifestation as the ultimate
  teacher (guru) of both celestial beings and ascetics.
preamble: This piece belongs to the bhakti song tradition of South Indian classical
  music, structured according to the Karnatak raga framework. Dattatreya worship,
  centred on the Dattatreya Upanishad and the Bhagavata Purana (Book XI), emphasizes
  the deity as the supreme guru and liberator. The composition invokes Anasūyā, the
  exemplary wife and mother of Dattatreya, alongside meditation on the deity's feet,
  dust, and the salvation-path he illuminates—core themes in Vaishnava and Shaiva
  Tantric traditions.
