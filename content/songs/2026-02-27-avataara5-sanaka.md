title: "5. సనత్కుమారా\tసనత్సుజాతా (చతురస్ర)"
date: '2026-02-27'
author: Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī
status: draft
abstract: A devotional composition in Telugu addressing Sanat Kumāra and the Sanatsujāta
  teaching, structured in pallavi form with anuṣṭup metre. The work weaves together
  Vedantic philosophy (ātma-tattva), the four forms of Hari, and the non-dual consciousness
  (turīya-sthāna) within a framework of devotional praise and scriptural inquiry into
  the nature of Self across cycles of creation and dissolution.
preamble: This composition draws from the Sanatsujāta Upaniṣad, a philosophical text
  associated with the Mahābhārata that presents dialogue on ātman-tattva (the nature
  of the Self). The work invokes Sanat Kumāra and his three brothers (Sanaka, Sanandana,
  and Sanat Kumāra) — the four Kumāras of classical Hindu cosmology — as eternal teachers
  dwelling in transcendent consciousness. The author engages with Advaita Vedāntic
  concepts of ātma-jñāna (Self-knowledge), the turīya state (fourth, non-dual consciousness),
  and Brahman as sat-chit-ānanda (existence-consciousness-bliss), positioning this
  as a devotional inquiry into the perennial teaching of mokṣa within Vaiṣṇava tradition.
