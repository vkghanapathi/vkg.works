abstract: A devotional song cycle celebrating the ten principal avatāras (divine incarnations)
  of Viṣṇu, composed in Telugu by Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī. Each song (mūrti)
  presents a distinct incarnation—from the cosmic boar (Varāha) to the god Nārada—structured
  as individual devotional hymns that praise both the cosmic significance and salvific
  power of each divine form. The work exemplifies the Bhāgavata Purāṇa tradition of
  avatāra theology within a modern Telugu devotional idiom.
preamble: This work belongs to the pan-Hindu theological tradition of avatāravāda
  (incarnationism), which teaches that the supreme deity Viṣṇu descends into the world
  in various forms to restore cosmic order (dharma) and grant liberation to devotees.
  The ten avatāras form the canonical sequence found in the Bhāgavata Purāṇa, one
  of Hinduism's most influential texts, which elaborates each incarnation as a response
  to specific cosmic crises. By rendering these narratives as devotional songs in
  Telugu, Dr. Ghanapāṭhī situates South Indian Śrīvaiṣṇava piety within classical
  Purāṇic theology, making the avatāras accessible to Telugu-speaking communities
  through an intimate, lyrical mode of worship.
