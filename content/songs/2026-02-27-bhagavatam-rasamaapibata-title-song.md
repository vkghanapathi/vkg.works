abstract: This work is a collection of devotional songs (bhajans) composed by Dr.
  Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī, representing contemporary engagement with Hindu devotional
  practice and musical theology. The songs exemplify the integration of classical
  Sanskrit/Telugu poetic traditions with modern musical composition, serving both
  as vehicles for spiritual expression and as scholarly artifacts documenting living
  devotional practices.
preamble: This song collection participates in the Indian bhajan tradition, a devotional
  practice rooted in medieval Hindu spirituality and systematized within Vaishnava,
  Shaiva, and eclectic Hindu worship frameworks. Bhajans function as congregational
  or individual acts of devotion (bhakti), often addressing specific deities or philosophical
  concepts central to Hindu theology. Dr. Ghanapāṭhī's compositions continue this
  tradition while maintaining scholarly rigor, drawing on classical meters and Sanskrit/Telugu
  linguistic conventions to articulate contemporary spiritual concerns within an ancient
  performative form.
