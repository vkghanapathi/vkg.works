abstract: A devotional hymn in Telugu celebrating Brahmānī (Sarasvatī), the divine
  consort of Brahma and embodiment of knowledge and creative speech. The composition
  employs classical Sanskrit-derived theological language to invoke the goddess through
  multiple manifestations and attributes, emphasizing her role as the primordial mother
  (Ādyā Mātā) and dispenser of transcendent wisdom (jñāna-sudhā).
preamble: This work belongs to the Śakta devotional tradition of Hindu theism, which
  venerates the divine feminine principle (Śakti) as the fundamental creative force
  of the cosmos. Brahmānī is one of the Sapta Mātṛikās (Seven Mothers) in classical
  Hindu iconography and serves as the Śakti counterpart of Brahma, the creator deity
  in the Trimūrti. The hymn draws on Vedāntic philosophy, particularly the non-dualistic
  understanding of consciousness (sat-chit-ānanda), while maintaining the devotional
  intensity characteristic of Telugu bhakti compositions. Such songs function both
  as meditative invocations and as expressions of the transcendent nature of the goddess
  within the framework of Tantric and Purāṇic theology.
