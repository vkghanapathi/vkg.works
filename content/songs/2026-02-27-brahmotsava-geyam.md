title: బ్రహ్మోత్సవ కీర్తన (చతురస్ర గతిః)
date: '2026-02-27'
author: Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī
status: draft
abstract: A devotional composition in Telugu (Brahmotsava Kīrtana) structured according
  to the Chaturasra Gati meter, celebrating the festival processions of Lord Vishnu
  through metaphorical exploration of eight sacred vehicle festivals. The work integrates
  Vedantic concepts of brahman-realization with Tantric yoga practices, offering spiritual
  interpretation of each procession as stages of inner transformation toward Self-knowledge.
preamble: This composition belongs to the Telugu devotional tradition centered on
  the annual Brahmotsava festival of Srirangam and other major Vaishnava temples in
  South India. Brahmotsava, one of Hinduism's most elaborate temple festivals, involves
  the ritual circumambulation of the deity through the streets on successive nights,
  each using a differently decorated vehicle or vahana. The kīrtana tradition draws
  on Vedantic philosophy while incorporating yogic and Tantric concepts—particularly
  kundalini symbolism—to reinterpret festival rituals as inner spiritual processes.
  Dr. Vamshi Krishna's composition exemplifies this scholarly devotionalism, addressing
  Lord Dattavenkateśvara while explicating the deeper metaphysical significance of
  each vehicle procession through Sanskrit-based Telugu verse.
