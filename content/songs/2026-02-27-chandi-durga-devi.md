abstract: A devotional hymn in Telugu that celebrates Durgā Devī through the enumeration
  of her manifold forms and epithets, each line invoking a distinct aspect or manifestation
  of the goddess while maintaining a consistent refrain (दुर्गामाता). The work demonstrates
  the non-dualistic theological framework in which the supreme divine feminine encompasses
  all goddesses and cosmic principles simultaneously.
preamble: This composition belongs to the tradition of Śaktism, which venerates the
  divine feminine principle (Śakti) as the ultimate reality. The enumeration of Durgā's
  forms—including the Navadurgā (nine forms of Durgā), regional goddesses such as
  Kālī, Lakṣmī, and Sarasvatī, and specific manifestations like Chandī, Chamundā,
  and Katyāyanī—reflects the devotional theology of the Devī Māhātmya and related
  tantric and Puranic traditions. The song functions as a devotional litany suitable
  for ritual worship (pūjā) or daily meditation, affirming the goddess's omnipresence
  across mythological narratives, yogic cosmology, and soteriological promise.
