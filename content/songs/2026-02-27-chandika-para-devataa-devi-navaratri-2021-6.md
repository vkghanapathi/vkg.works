title: నవరాత్రి 21.6 (చండీహోమః)
date: '2026-02-27'

status: draft
abstract: A devotional song-cycle for the Chandi Homa (fire-offering ritual to the
  goddess Chandi) performed during the nine-day Navaratri festival. The text comprises
  four metrically structured verses with extensive prose commentary (bhāvārtha) explaining
  the mythological, ritual, and spiritual significance of the Devi Mahatmya narrative
  and the prescribed oblations, designed to guide practitioners in performing the
  annual autumnal observance.
preamble: This work belongs to the Shakta ritual and devotional tradition centred
  on the Devi Mahatmya (Saptashati), a Sanskrit liturgical text embedded in the Markandeya
  Purana. The Chandi Homa is a prescribed fire-sacrifice honouring the supreme goddess
  Chandi (Durga) through thirteen chapters of mantra recitation, concluding in votive
  offerings of clarified butter, rice-paste, seeds, flowers, and fruits. Dr. Ghanapathi's
  composition serves as a vernacular ritual guide for Telugu-speaking practitioners,
  synthesizing Vedic (Savitri-Agni) observance calendars with Puranic narratives of
  the goddess's three cosmic victories.
