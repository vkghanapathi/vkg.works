title: अभोगि राग कीर्तनम् – चन्द्रशेखर गुण

status: draft
abstract: A devotional kīrtanam (sung narrative hymn) dedicated to Śiva in his form
  as Candraśekhar (the moon-crowned god), structured as a daily recitative praising
  his virtues and seeking liberation from worldly suffering. The composition interweaves
  Sanskrit mantra-like invocations with rhythmic syllabic passages designed for vocal
  performance, employing the rāga tradition of Carnatic music to facilitate meditative
  and devotional practice.
preamble: This kīrtanam belongs to the South Indian bhakti tradition of Śaiva devotional
  music, where Sanskrit sacred poetry is set to classical Indian melodic frameworks
  (rāga) for ritual and domestic worship. Kīrtanams are lyrical-musical compositions
  that combine philosophical invocation, mythological narration, and musical technique;
  they constitute a primary devotional medium in temples and spiritual communities,
  particularly within the Smārta and Śaiva schools. The text addresses Śiva—manifested
  as the auspicious ('Śiva'), the universe-pervading principle ('Hara'), and the compassionate
  destroyer of karma—whilst seeking his grace for spiritual liberation (mokṣa) and
  protection.
