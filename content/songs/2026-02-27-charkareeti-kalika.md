abstract: A devotional song sequence composed in Sanskrit, invoking the divine feminine
  principle as Kālīkā (the Dark Mother). The work employs rhythmic syllabic patterns
  and anaphoric repetition of the refrain 'Mātṛkā mama Kālīkā' (My Mother Kālīkā)
  across four stanzas, each presenting metaphysical attributes of the goddess—her
  creative utterance, transcendence of duality, dissolution of tamasic obscuration,
  and ultimate identity with Sat-Chit-Ānanda (being-consciousness-bliss). This composition
  represents a form of tantric devotional poetry emphasizing the goddess's role in
  both cosmic manifestation and individual spiritual transformation.
preamble: This work belongs to the Sanskrit tantric devotional tradition, which understands
  the divine feminine (Śakti) as the supreme creative and liberatory force underlying
  phenomenal reality. The invocation of Kālīkā places the composition within Śaiva-Śakta
  theology, where the goddess encompasses both fierce destructive power and benevolent
  maternal grace. The repetitive liturgical structure and the progression from cosmic
  functions (creation, sustenance, dissolution) to soteriological realization suggests
  this may serve as a ritual incantation or meditation text within Tantric Śaivism,
  where sacred sound (mantra) and the Mother Goddess are understood as non-dual.
