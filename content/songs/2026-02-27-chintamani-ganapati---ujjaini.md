title: (మంగళారతి కీర్తన, మందగతి, తిస్ర నడక కీర్తన)

status: draft
abstract: A devotional kīrtana (Telugu religious song) composed by Dr. Vamshi Krishna
  Ghanapāṭhī in honour of Cintāmaṇi Gaṇapati, a form of the elephant-headed deity
  worshipped at the Kāśī (Varanasi) temple. The song presents a philosophical meditation
  on desire, thought, and liberation, teaching that the deity transcends all guṇas
  (qualities) and states of consciousness, and that true contentment arises from the
  dissolution of mental constructs rather than the fulfilment of worldly wishes.
preamble: This work belongs to the Telugu bhakti tradition, which emphasizes devotional
  surrender and congregational singing as paths to liberation. Gaṇapati (also Gaṇeśa)
  is invoked in Hindu practice as the remover of obstacles and the lord of beginnings;
  the epithet Cintāmaṇi ('wish-fulfilling jewel') reframes the deity as one who grants
  inner peace through the transcendence of desire rather than its satisfaction. The
  composition includes elaborate textual commentary explaining the philosophical implications
  of each verse, a common feature of ghanapāṭha (systematic recitation) pedagogy.
  The work prescribes ritual practices—invocations, offerings, worship with sandalwood
  and vermillion, fire rituals, and monthly vows—situating philosophical teaching
  within living religious practice.
