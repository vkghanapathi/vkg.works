abstract: A devotional song sequence (kirtan) invoking Ganesha as Chintamani, the
  wish-fulfilling jewel, structured as a dialogue between the deity and devotee. The
  composition explores the metaphysical principle of Chintamani—the transcendent,
  wish-granting force embodied in Ganesha—as the sole remedy for universal human suffering
  arising from unfulfilled desires and anxieties.
preamble: This work belongs to the Marathi Mangalarati kirtan tradition, a devotional
  song form integral to Hindu household rituals and temple worship. Mangalarati kiritans
  typically invoke auspicious beginnings through deity worship; this particular composition
  situates itself within Ganapati (Ganesha) devotionalism, a widespread pan-Indian
  practice emphasizing the elephant-headed deity as the remover of obstacles and dispenser
  of blessings. The Chintamani metaphor—drawing from Sanskrit literary and philosophical
  tradition—frames Ganesha as the ultimate fulfillment of desire, positioned against
  the existential problem of unfulfilled wishes and perpetual suffering in worldly
  life.
