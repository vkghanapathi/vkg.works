abstract: Datta Charitam is a musical treatise composed by His Holiness Sri Ganapathy
  Sachchidananda Swamiji that expounds the story, philosophy, and teachings of Dattatreya
  through Carnatic classical compositions. Set to music by Vidwan Malladi SuriBabu
  and performed by accomplished musicians, the work integrates Sanskrit mantras, philosophical
  doctrine, and devotional content within a carefully structured cycle of kritis (compositions)
  designed to constitute a complete Datta Darshana Parayanam (recitation of Dattatreya's
  vision).
preamble: This work participates in the Carnatic music tradition of South India, wherein
  sacred narratives and philosophical teachings are encoded within classical ragas
  and talas. The composition draws upon the devotional and philosophical traditions
  centred on Dattatreya, a non-dualistic guru figure revered in Hindu spirituality
  as an incarnation of the Trimurti (Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva). Through the integration
  of Kundalini Shaakta concepts (invocation of Muladhara) and Guru-centric soteriology,
  the work synthesizes musical performance with spiritual practice, rendering the
  recitation and hearing of these compositions as vehicles for spiritual attainment.
