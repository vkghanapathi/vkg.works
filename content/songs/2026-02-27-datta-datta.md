abstract: A devotional song invoking Datta Deva (the embodiment of divine grace and
  instruction) for protection and welfare during times of suffering. Structured as
  a refrain with four thematic verses, the work petitions for ritual purity, bodily
  sustenance, relief from poverty and disease, mantra efficacy, compassion toward
  all beings, and ultimate liberation into divine bliss. The composition exemplifies
  the bhakti tradition's integration of therapeutic, ethical, and salvific concerns
  within a framework of divine supplication.
preamble: This work belongs to the Telugu devotional (bhakti) tradition and invokes
  Datta, a Hindu deity widely venerated as the embodiment of the guru principle and
  divine compassion. Datta is honored in both Shaiva and Vaishnava contexts, and appears
  prominently in the Bhāgavata Purāṇa as the son of Atri and Anasuyā. The present
  composition addresses Datta in the context of human suffering—disease, poverty,
  conflict, and sorrow—and employs a call-and-response structure with repetitive affirmations
  (dattā datta) characteristic of devotional recitation (kīrtan and bhajan) practices.
  The four-verse elaboration reflects the comprehensive scope of Hindu theodicy and
  grace.
