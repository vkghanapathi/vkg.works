abstract: A devotional song (bhajan) celebrating Datta, the deity revered as an incarnation
  of the Trimurti (Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva unified), with invocations to Hṛṣīkeśvara.
  The composition addresses Datta's manifestation during the Āśvina month, his role
  as guru to the twenty-four spiritual principles (Caturvimśati), and his protective
  sovereignty over Yadu kingdom, while expounding the philosophical doctrine of avadhūta
  (the liberated ascetic state) and invoking spiritual awakening through discriminative
  knowledge (viveka).
preamble: This song belongs to the Datta Bhakti tradition, a significant devotional
  movement within Hindu spirituality that centers on Dattātreya—a syncretic deity
  encompassing Vedāntic non-dualism and ascetic renunciation. Dattātreya is venerated
  across South India and Maharashtra as the ultimate guru and embodiment of spiritual
  liberation. The composition invokes him through the epithet Dīgambara (sky-clad,
  symbolizing renunciation) and situates his worship within the sacred calendar and
  philosophical frameworks of classical Indian spirituality. The song's teaching on
  discrimination between the graspable and rejectable (grāhya-tyājya) reflects Advaita
  Vedāntic epistemology.
