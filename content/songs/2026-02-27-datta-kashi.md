abstract: Pallavi is a devotional song cycle in Telugu celebrating the sacred geography
  and divine narrative of Datta Kāśī, a pilgrimage site in the Deccan associated with
  the deity Dattātreya and the convergence of the Arkāvatī and Kāverī rivers. The
  work interweaves hagiographical narrative with philosophical commentary on the role
  of sacred geography, breath control, and spiritual realization, drawing on the legendary
  genealogy of sages (Bharadvāja, Harita, Agastya) and the biographical account of
  the saint Narasimha Śāstrī and his consort Jayalakṣmī as vehicles for Dattātreya's
  incarnation.
preamble: This work belongs to the devotional Dattātreya tradition of South India,
  particularly as cultivated in Karnataka and Maharashtra. Dattātreya, understood
  as an embodiment of the Trimūrti (Brahmā, Viṣṇu, Śiva unified), is venerated as
  a transcendent guru-deity whose appearance in human form through spiritually advanced
  lineages constitutes a central theme of Dattātreya bhakti literature. The Pallavi
  employs the classical Sanskrit/Telugu musical form—a song with multiple verses (varṇams)
  and an explanatory prose commentary—to make accessible to devotees the sacred history
  and metaphysical dimensions of Datta Kāśī as a power-place for yoga sādhana.
