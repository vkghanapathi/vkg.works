abstract: This work presents a collection of devotional songs exploring Datta Kriya
  Yoga, a spiritual discipline centred on ritual action and divine service within
  the Dattatreya tradition. The songs articulate the philosophical and practical dimensions
  of yoga as understood through the lens of the three-form deity Dattatreya, emphasising
  the integration of ritual practice (kriya) with yogic discipline.
preamble: Datta Kriya Yoga situates itself within the Dattatreya lineage, a significant
  tradition in Hindu devotionalism that venerates Dattatreya as the supreme guru and
  embodiment of the holy trinity (Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva). This work draws on Tantric
  and classical yoga frameworks to articulate a path of devotion expressed through
  structured ritual action and bodily discipline. The song genre employed here reflects
  a widespread practice in Indian religious literature of encoding philosophical and
  soteriological teachings in lyrical, memorisable verse, facilitating both scholarly
  study and devotional practice.
