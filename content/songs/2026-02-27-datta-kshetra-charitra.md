abstract: A devotional song (padyam) in Telugu celebrating Datta Kṣetra, the sacred
  pilgrimage site associated with Guru Dattātreya, an incarnation revered across Hindu,
  Buddhist, and Nātha traditions. The composition invokes Dattātreya's sixteen forms
  and his universal salvific grace, whilst grounding classical Vedāntic philosophy—particularly
  the Upaniṣadic doctrine of Sat-Chit-Ānanda (Being-Consciousness-Bliss)—in the accessible
  guru-śiṣya relationship.
preamble: This work belongs to the Telugu devotional poetry tradition centred on Dattātreya
  worship, particularly at Datta Kṣetra (historically located in the Deccan region).
  Dattātreya, the three-headed or omniform deity synthesizing Brahmā, Viṣṇu, and Śiva,
  occupies a unique position in Hindu philosophy as an embodiment of the non-dual
  Self accessible to seekers across multiple epochs. The composition situates Vedāntic
  teaching—especially Upaniṣadic non-duality—within the dynamic framework of guru-led
  spiritual transformation, reflecting the renaissance of classical learning and contemporary
  spiritual philosophy that characterises modern Telugu ghanapāṭhī composition.
