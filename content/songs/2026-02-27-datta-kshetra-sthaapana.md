abstract: A devotional composition in Telugu celebrating the establishment of sixteen
  sacred sites (kṣetras) dedicated to Datta across the Indian subcontinent. The work
  praises Śrīpāda Nṛsiṃha Sarasvatī, a historical guru of the Datta tradition, who
  sanctified these pilgrimage centers and nine additional sites associated with the
  nine Nātha masters, demonstrating the unity of divine manifestations across different
  locales and deities.
preamble: This work belongs to the Datta Sampradāya (tradition of Dattatreya), a Hindu
  philosophical and devotional lineage centered on Dattatreya, the composite incarnation
  of the Hindu trinity (Brahmā, Viṣṇu, Śiva). The composition invokes Dattatreya as
  the supreme guru and world-teacher (jagadguru), and commemorates the consecration
  of pilgrimage sites (tīrtha-sthānas) and temple establishments (devatāyatanas) across
  India. Śrīpāda Nṛsiṃha Sarasvatī is venerated as a pivotal figure in formalizing
  and spreading the Datta tradition through the creation of these sacred centers,
  each inscribed with nine-syllable seed mantras (nava-bījakṣara), thus unifying diverse
  forms of worship within a single metaphysical vision.
