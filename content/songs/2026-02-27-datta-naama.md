abstract: Datta Nāma Kīrtana is a devotional hymnic composition in Telugu comprising
  two interconnected sections of praise songs dedicated to Dattātreya, the tri-form
  avatar embodying Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva. The work functions as both a philosophical
  invocation and a practical devotional text, instructing the practitioner to cultivate
  mental and ethical discipline through repetitive recitation of the deity's name
  while adhering to fundamental dharmic principles.
preamble: This composition belongs to the bhakti devotional tradition of South Indian
  temple worship and household practice, specifically centred on Dattātreya, a non-Vedic
  but widely venerated ascetic divinity of the Puranic corpus. The work exemplifies
  the kīrtana (song of praise) genre, a fundamental mode of Hindu devotional expression
  combining theological instruction with mnemonic repetition. The dual structure—first
  presenting ethical imperatives framed through devotion, second invoking the triad
  of cosmic principles—reflects the integration of dharma (righteous conduct), nāma-japa
  (name recitation), and saccidānanda (being-consciousness-bliss) within Vedantic
  philosophy. Such compositions serve both as aids to contemplative practice and as
  accessible vehicles for doctrinal transmission in vernacular contexts.
