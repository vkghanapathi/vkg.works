abstract: A devotional hymn sequence in Telugu composed by Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī
  celebrating Datta Yogirāja, the divine synthesis of Brahmā, Viṣṇu, and Śiva as supreme
  guru. The work invokes the liberatory grace of this unified deity, emphasizing the
  dissolution of mental suffering, fear of transmigration, and the bestowal of wisdom
  and spiritual realization upon the devotee's heart.
preamble: Dattātreya devotionalism represents a distinct current within Hindu tantric
  and yogic traditions, wherein the divine preceptor manifests as the unified form
  of the Trimurti. This composition belongs to the Telugu bhakti-nāṭya tradition,
  wherein philosophical insight and emotional devotion are woven together through
  metrical song. The invocation of Datta Yogirāja as both cosmic principle (sat-chit-ānanda,
  being-consciousness-bliss) and intimate spiritual guide reflects the Advaitic framework
  endemic to Śaiva and non-dualist schools, wherein the guru embodies ultimate reality
  and serves as the sole means of liberation.
