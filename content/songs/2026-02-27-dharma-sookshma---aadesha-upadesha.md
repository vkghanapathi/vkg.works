abstract: A bilingual devotional and ethical instruction composed in Sanskrit and
  Telugu, presenting a systematic teaching on dharma (righteous conduct) and the proper
  way of living according to Vedic principles. The work emphasizes the subtle understanding
  of dharma, the emulation of virtuous exemplars, and the cultivation of moral qualities—humility,
  generosity, and reverence—as the path to lasting peace and spiritual fulfilment
  (sat-chit-ānanda).
preamble: This composition belongs to the didactic song tradition within Vedic-aligned
  Hindu philosophical literature, drawing on the normative ethical framework of śiṣṭa
  (virtuous society) and ācāryavarga (the community of learned teachers). It functions
  as an upadeśa (teaching or counsel) rooted in Vedic cosmology and the classical
  theory of dharma articulated in dharmaśāstra texts. The bilingual presentation in
  Sanskrit and Telugu reflects the syncretism of North Indian Sanskrit learning with
  South Indian regional literary traditions, characteristic of early modern scholarly
  compositions in India.
