abstract: A devotional song cycle attributed to Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī, structured
  around the invocation 'Dōlikā Māróhaye' (swing, ascend). The work employs Sanskrit
  phonetic parallelism and iterative vocables characteristic of ghanapāṭha (Vedic
  intensive recitation), adapting classical ghanapāṭha methodology to devotional song
  composition. This represents a contemporary scholarly engagement with traditional
  Vedic recitation techniques applied to bhakti literature.
preamble: This composition emerges from the Vedic recitation tradition of ghanapāṭha,
  a specialized mnemonic and performance method documented in the Śikṣā texts and
  practised within Vedic brahminical communities to ensure textual preservation. Dr.
  Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī, a contemporary scholar-practitioner of ghanapāṭha methodology,
  integrates elements of this rigorous phonetic discipline with devotional (bhakti)
  song forms. The work participates in a living tradition that links Vedic oral transmission
  to vernacular religious expression, exemplifying how classical recitation techniques
  inform modern sacred composition.
