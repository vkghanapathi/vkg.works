abstract: A devotional song in Telugu addressed to the principal forms of the Divine
  Feminine—Durgā, Lakṣmī, Sāvitrī, Gaurī, and Vāṇī—invoking their protective and auspicious
  powers. Composed in Mathyatāḷam metre (10 mātrās) with Kāpi rāga, the work structures
  its praise through a pallavi (refrain) and three numbered verses (anupallavi sections)
  that enumerate the goddesses' attributes, including their role as givers of virtue,
  destroyers of vice, and embodiments of sat-chit-ānanda (being-consciousness-bliss).
preamble: This song belongs to the bhakti devotional tradition of South India, specifically
  addressing the Śakta understanding of divinity as the supreme feminine principle
  (Devī). The invocation of multiple forms of the Goddess—each representing distinct
  cosmic functions such as protection (Durgā), abundance (Lakṣmī), knowledge (Vāṇī),
  and benevolence (Gaurī)—reflects the Tantric and Purāṇic theology in which these
  manifestations are understood as expressions of a singular transcendent power (Śakti).
  The composition employs the classical Indian musical framework of rāga-tāḷa to structure
  its devotional praise.
