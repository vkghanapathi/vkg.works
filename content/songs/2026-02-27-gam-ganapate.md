abstract: Gaṇeśa 32 is a devotional hymn composed in Telugu that invokes the elephant-headed
  deity Gaṇapati (Gaṇeśa) through multiple epithets and names, celebrating his roles
  as remover of obstacles, bestower of prosperity, and vanquisher of difficulties.
  The work exemplifies the Ghanapāṭhī tradition of compact, densely-packed devotional
  composition, where successive verses accumulate divine attributes and alternate
  names in rhythmic, liturgically-structured patterns.
preamble: This piece belongs to the Hindu devotional tradition (bhakti) centred on
  Gaṇeśa, the elephant-headed deity worshipped as the remover of obstacles (vighnahara)
  and the lord of beginnings in Vedic and Puranic theology. Gaṇeśa veneration appears
  prominently in the Ghaṇapāṭha texts and regional devotional compositions across
  South India. The work draws on the Śākta (goddess-centred) and Smarta (multi-deity)
  traditions, invoking Gaṇeśa alongside Lakṣmī, Durgā, and other divine forms. Dr.
  Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī's composition follows a traditional format of refrain-and-verse
  (pallavi-charaṇa) typical of South Indian devotional music and ritual recitation.
