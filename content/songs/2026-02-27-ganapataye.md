abstract: A devotional hymn in Telugu composed in six-beat meter, offering elaborate
  praise and obeisance to Gaṇapati (Ganesha). The work employs polyphonic repetition
  and metrical sophistication to structure verses of invocation, petition, and reverent
  submission, demonstrating the integration of musical form with devotional expression.
preamble: This composition belongs to the vernacular devotional tradition of South
  India, specifically the Telugu bhakti corpus addressing Gaṇapati, the elephant-headed
  deity revered as remover of obstacles and lord of beginnings. The work follows the
  classical structure of stotra (laudatory hymn) with anustup and caraṇa (refrain
  sections), employing the six-beat rhythmic framework (ṣaṭ-tāla) characteristic of
  Carnatic musical prosody. The repeated invocations (gaṇapataye, pranidhimatam) and
  the appeal to the guru's grace reflect the integrated devotional aesthetics of South
  Indian temple and domestic worship contexts.
