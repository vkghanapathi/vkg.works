abstract: A devotional song-cycle (kīrtana) centered on Ganesha (Gaṇapati), composed
  in Telugu, structured as a mantra-infused invocation with repeated divine names
  and protective formulae. The work integrates Vedic mantra elements with devotional
  song, emphasizing Ganesha's role as remover of obstacles and bestower of wisdom,
  composed during the new moon observance (Mauni Amāvāsya) at Viśākhapattnam in January
  2012.
preamble: This work belongs to the bhakti tradition of South Indian devotional practice,
  specifically the kīrtana form—a sung narrative or praise-poem dedicated to a particular
  deity. Ganesha, the elephant-faced son of Śiva and Pārvatī (Gaurī), occupies a foundational
  place in Hindu ritual and worship as the remover of obstacles (Vighneśa) and the
  lord of beginnings. The composition fuses mantra recitation (mantramayā) with melodic
  devotion, a characteristic feature of Telugu-language religious music that draws
  on both Vedic and Tantric traditions. The invocation of Ganesha's protective power
  (rakṣaṇa) through repetition and the naming of divine attributes reflects the Tantric
  emphasis on sound, energy (śakti), and the transformative potential of sacred utterance.
