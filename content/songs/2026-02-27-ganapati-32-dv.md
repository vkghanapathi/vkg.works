title: गणेश द्वात्रिंशत् (32 रूपनामानि)
date: '2026-02-27'

status: draft
abstract: A liturgical enumeration of thirty-two names and forms of Gaṇeśa (Ganesha),
  presented in both verse and devotional chant (kīrtana) format. This work exemplifies
  the Hindu devotional practice of nāma-japa (recitation of sacred names) and offers
  worshippers a structured invocation believed to grant material prosperity, removal
  of obstacles, and spiritual fulfilment.
preamble: This composition belongs to the tradition of Gaṇeśa worship (Gaṇeśa-pūjā)
  and nāma-stotra literature in Hindu devotionalism. Gaṇeśa, the elephant-headed deity
  of auspiciousness and remover of obstacles, occupies a central place in both Śaiva
  and broader Hindu ritual practice. The enumeration of divine names and forms (rūpa-nāma)
  is a classical devotional method found throughout Sanskrit hymnody, particularly
  in works like the Gaṇeśa Sahasranāma and regional compositions. The concluding verses
  promise that one who chants these thirty-two names shall attain wealth without hindrance
  (nirviggna) and experience the reality of sat-chit-ānanda (existence-consciousness-bliss).
  The date attribution and reference to Chintāmaṇi Gaṇapati temple locate this as
  a modern devotional composition authored by Vanshi Krishna Ghanapathi on 31 August
  2019.
