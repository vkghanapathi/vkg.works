abstract: A devotional song cycle enumerating thirty-two forms and epithets of Gaṇeśa
  (Ganesha), structured as both a lyrical composition in Telugu and a Sanskrit verse
  codification. The work systematically invokes Gaṇeśa across his various manifestations—from
  the youthful (bāla) to the mature (taruṇa) forms—while emphasizing his powers to
  remove obstacles, grant prosperity, and bestow intellectual clarity. The final verses
  promise material and spiritual rewards to the devotee who recites these thirty-two
  names.
preamble: This composition belongs to the Gaṇeśa-bhakti (devotion to Ganesha) tradition
  within Hindu worship, drawing upon the widespread practice of venerating Gaṇeśa,
  the elephant-headed deity revered as the remover of obstacles and lord of beginnings.
  The enumeration of divine names and forms (nāma-stava) is a classical devotional
  technique found throughout Sanskrit and vernacular Hindu literature, particularly
  in Puranic and tantric contexts. The work combines Telugu vernacular composition
  with Sanskrit verse structure (ślokas), reflecting the scholarly integration of
  regional and classical Sanskrit literary traditions practised in medieval and early
  modern South India. The thirty-two forms referenced here represent different aspects
  of Gaṇeśa's cosmic and devotional significance, each invoked for distinct spiritual
  and material benefits.
