abstract: A devotional song in Telugu addressing Gaṇapati (Ganesha) through the repeated
  invocation of Saccidānanda (being-consciousness-bliss), the non-dual ultimate reality.
  The composition employs a responsive call-and-response structure between the speaker's
  guru and Gaṇapati, attributing to the deity a series of divine attributes expressed
  through systematic word pairs that explore the nature of enlightenment, liberation,
  and spiritual protection.
preamble: This work belongs to the Bhakti tradition of devotional singing in Telugu,
  a practice deeply rooted in South Indian Hindu spirituality. The invocation of Saccidānanda
  reflects Advaita Vedānta philosophy, which understands ultimate reality as non-dual
  consciousness. Gaṇapati (Ganesha), traditionally worshipped as the remover of obstacles
  and the lord of knowledge, is here addressed not merely as a deity but as an embodiment
  of the highest spiritual principle. The guru-disciple framework evident in the response
  structure situates this song within the context of sampradāya (lineage) transmission,
  where the guru guides the devotee toward direct recognition of the divine.
