abstract: This work presents a collection of devotional songs (bhajans) that forms
  part of Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī's broader corpus of Sanskrit and regional-language
  compositions. The songs represent a continuation of the classical Indian tradition
  of devotional lyric poetry, employing musical and metrical structures suited for
  performance and congregational singing.
preamble: This collection of songs belongs to the bhakti tradition of Hindu devotional
  literature, wherein poetic compositions serve as vehicles for expressing devotion
  to the divine. The songs draw upon the rich heritage of Indian classical music theory
  and prosody, combining Sanskrit literary conventions with the accessibility of melodic
  forms. Such compositions have historically functioned both as objects of aesthetic
  appreciation and as aids to spiritual practice within Hindu worship and contemplative
  traditions.
