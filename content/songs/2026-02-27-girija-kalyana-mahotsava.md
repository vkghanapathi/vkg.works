abstract: A devotional song-cycle in Telugu celebrating the divine marriage of Parameśvara
  (Śiva) and Giriјā (Pārvati), structured as five stanzas of laudatory verse. The
  work employs classical Sanskrit poetic conventions embedded within Telugu composition,
  depicting the auspicious rituals, cosmic significance, and metaphysical union of
  the divine couple as a manifestation of Śiva-Śakti integration.
preamble: This composition belongs to the Telugu bhakti and court-poetry traditions
  of South India, drawing on the Purāṇic narrative of Śiva's marriage to Pārvati—a
  foundational mythological event in Hindu cosmology. The work invokes scriptural
  authorities (the seven sages), ritual protocols (madhuparka, maṅgalya ceremonies),
  and Advaitic philosophy to frame the divine union as simultaneously a historical
  event, a metaphysical principle, and a model for earthly matrimonial devotion. Such
  compositions typically functioned in temple liturgy, royal patronage contexts, and
  philosophical discourse.
