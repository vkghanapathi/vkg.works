abstract: Bhajana Yogam is a devotional composition in Telugu structured as a guru-centered
  bhakti hymn set to Hamsanandi raga and Rupaka tala. The work combines Sanskrit-inflected
  Telugu devotional verse with an extended rhythmic vocalization section (solfège
  passage), exemplifying the integration of melodic form, metric structure, and meditative
  repetition characteristic of South Indian classical music-devotion synthesis.
preamble: This composition belongs to the tradition of guru-bhakti (devotion to the
  spiritual preceptor) within South Indian Vedantic practice, as mediated through
  classical Carnatic music aesthetics. The work emphasizes the guru's feet (charanaṃbhoja)
  as the object of veneration and prescribes disciplined practice (abhyasana) and
  meditation upon the guru's name as the path to liberation. The rhythmic vocalization
  section demonstrates the samgita tradition's use of abstract syllabic patterns (solkattu)
  as a form of concentrated mental practice aligned with yogic discipline.
