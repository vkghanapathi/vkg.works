abstract: A devotional song (kīrtana) in Telugu composed for Guru Pūrṇimā (the full
  moon honoring the guru principle), structured in the classical three-part form of
  pallavi, anupallavi, and charaṇa sections. The composition systematizes veneration
  of multiple guru lineages—from Vyāsa and Dattātreya through Vasiṣṭha and Nārada
  to Śaṅkarācārya and Śrīpāda Vallabha—while emphasizing the liberatory function of
  guru worship (gurupūjana) as the means of transcending saṃsāra.
preamble: Guru Pūrṇimā is observed in the Hindu liturgical calendar on the full moon
  of Āshaḍha (June–July), commemorating both the birth of Vyāsa (compiler of the Vedas)
  and the guru-disciple transmission lineage central to Advaita Vedānta and bhakti
  traditions. This kīrtana belongs to the khanda-gati (sectioned or modular) performance
  style, designed for congregational singing in ritual or devotional contexts. The
  work invokes the standard pantheon of realized gurus recognized across Vedānta schools,
  presenting guru-worship as both a spiritual practice and a path to self-realization
  (brahma-anubhāva).
