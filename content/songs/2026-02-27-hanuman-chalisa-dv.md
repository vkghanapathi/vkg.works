abstract: This is a Telugu-language devotional rendering of the Hanumān Chālīsā, a
  forty-verse Hindi hymn of praise to Hanumān, the monkey deity and devoted follower
  of Rāma. The work preserves the doctrinal and narrative substance of the original
  composition while presenting it in Telugu, making the devotional text accessible
  to Telugu-speaking communities. It exemplifies the regional vernacularization and
  living transmission of pan-Hindu devotional poetry across linguistic boundaries.
preamble: The Hanumān Chālīsā belongs to the bhakti (devotional) tradition of Hinduism,
  particularly within the Rāma-centered devotionalism established by Tulsī Dās in
  the sixteenth century. The original forty-verse hymn celebrates Hanumān as the perfect
  exemplar of courage, wisdom, unwavering devotion, and selfless service to Rāma,
  the seventh avatāra of Viṣṇu. This Telugu adaptation extends the reach of that devotional
  legacy by rendering the hymn in a South Indian language, thereby sustaining the
  practice of daily recitation and ritual worship among Tamil-Kannada-Telugu linguistic
  communities who venerate both Hanumān independently and as the essential devotee
  within Rāma's narrative cosmos.
