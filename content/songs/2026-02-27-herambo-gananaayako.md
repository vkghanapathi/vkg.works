abstract: A devotional song (kīrtana) in Saurāṣṭra rāga composed in the classical
  South Indian musical framework of mišra-chāpu tāla. The work invokes Gaṇapati (Ganesha)
  as the remover of obstacles and lord of wisdom, structured in the traditional pallavi-anupallavi-charaṇa
  format with two temporal sections (kālam). This composition exemplifies the integration
  of Vedic mantra-based devotion with classical Carnatic musical aesthetics, positioning
  Gaṇapati as the foundational principle underlying both ritualistic practice and
  the sonic essence of Brahmanical tradition.
preamble: This kīrtana belongs to the bhakti music tradition of South India, specifically
  the Carnatic classical system where devotional compositions are set to prescribed
  rāgas (melodic modes) and tālas (rhythmic cycles). The work draws upon the Gāṇapatya
  tradition—the worship of Gaṇapati as supreme deity—which is rooted in Purāṇic and
  Tantric sources. In this framework, Gaṇapati is venerated not merely as a remover
  of obstacles but as the primordial cosmic principle (Brahman) manifest in sound
  and ritual action. The invocation of Vedic mantras and the reference to Brahmanaspati
  (lord of sacred speech) situate this composition within the overlap between Vedic
  ritualism and devotional music, a characteristic feature of Telugu and Sanskrit
  kīrtana literature.
