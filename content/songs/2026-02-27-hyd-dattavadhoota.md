abstract: A devotional hymn in Telugu composed in honour of Dattātreya and Gorakshnāth,
  two pivotal figures in Yoga and Nāth siddha traditions. The work comprises two verses
  structured as a refrain and chorus, invoking protection, grace, and spiritual illumination
  through the lineage of the Nāth yogis. The composition exemplifies the devotional-yogic
  fusion characteristic of South Indian Nāth-sampradāya literature.
preamble: This work belongs to the Nāth Yoga tradition, a medieval ascetic lineage
  that synthesised Tantra, Hatha Yoga, and Vedantic philosophy across North and South
  India. Dattātreya, venerated as the archetypal guru and embodiment of the Godhead
  in Yoga texts, and Gorakshnāth, the legendary systematiser of Hatha Yoga, are central
  deities in Nāth devotionalism. The hymn invokes their benevolent protection (pāla)
  over the practitioner's spiritual path, particularly during auspicious lunar dates
  such as Jyeṣṭha Pūrṇimā (the full moon of Jyeṣṭha month), traditionally associated
  with Nāth lineage observances. Such songs function as both ritual offerings and
  meditative aids within Nāth sampradāya practice.
