title: నవరాత్రి 21.7 (ఇంద్రకీలాద్రి కథ)
date: '2026-02-27'
author: Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī
status: draft
abstract: A mythological narrative in Telugu verse recounting the origin and consecration
  of Indrakīlādrī (Indrakīla Hill), a sacred mountain shrine dedicated to Durgā Devī.
  The text documents the yakṣa Kīla's austere penance, the goddess's post-buffalo-demon
  victory manifestation at the peak, and the subsequent worship by Indra and the celestial
  hosts, establishing the site's theological and ritual significance.
preamble: This work belongs to the Sanskrit and Telugu devotional hymnic tradition
  (bhakti-kāvya) and functions as a sthala-purāṇa, or shrine-specific mythological
  charter. It articulates the sanctification narrative of a major Shaiva-Shakta pilgrimage
  site in the Deccan, narrating how Durgā Devī comes to embody the mountain itself
  in golden radiance (kanaka-rūpa) following her destruction of Mahiṣāsura. The composition
  simultaneously honors the presence of Mallīśvara (an aspect of Śiva) as the primordial
  lord of the site, thereby integrating Vedantic philosophy (sat-chit-ānanda) into
  regional Hindu devotional geography.
