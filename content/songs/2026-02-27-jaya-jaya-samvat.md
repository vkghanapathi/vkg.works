abstract: A devotional song cycle composed in Telugu that celebrates the Moon (Soma/Chandra)
  through a series of laudatory epithets and philosophical commentaries. The work
  situates lunar worship within Vedic cosmology, presenting the Moon as sovereign
  of the auspicious Jaya Samvatsara (Year of Victory) and expounding on its role as
  protector of herbs, guardian of the mind, and purifier of mental affliction according
  to Vedic tradition.
preamble: This composition belongs to the tradition of Vedic hymnic poetry in Telugu,
  drawing upon Yajurvedic cosmological principles and lunar theology. The work invokes
  the Moon (Soma) as both a celestial deity and a metaphysical principle governing
  natural order, vegetation, and mental discipline. It participates in the broader
  Hindu ritual calendar system of samvatsara (year) nomenclature, where specific years
  are assigned presiding deities and auspicious qualities. The author's exegetical
  apparatus—providing Sanskrit etymologies and Vedic references—grounds the devotional
  lyrics in scriptural authority, particularly the Yajurveda.
