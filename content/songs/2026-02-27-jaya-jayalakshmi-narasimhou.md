abstract: A devotional composition in Telugu celebrating an auspicious marriage ceremony
  (Kalyāṇotsava), structured as a series of blessing verses (Vijayetāṃ) invoking divine
  favor upon the bride and groom. The work exemplifies the lyrical conventions of
  Telugu court poetry, combining genealogical praise (Haritabhāradwāja lineage), Vedic
  ritual propriety, and melodic performance instructions typical of Ghanapāṭhī's compositional
  method.
preamble: This work belongs to the Telugu devotional and ceremonial poetry tradition,
  specifically the sub-genre of marriage benedictions (Kalyāṇa-gīta). Composed within
  the Vaiṣṇava ritual framework, it invokes Lakṣmī (goddess of auspiciousness) and
  Narasiṃha (fierce protector form of Viṣṇu) as presiding deities over the conjugal
  union. The composition adheres to classical Vedic values—including references to
  gotra lineages (Bharadvāja), the sapta-padī ceremony (seven ritual steps), and regional
  propriety (Karnataka and Andhra traditions)—while maintaining the rhythmic and melodic
  structures characteristic of performance-oriented Telugu court compositions.
