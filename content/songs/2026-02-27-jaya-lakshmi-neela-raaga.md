abstract: A devotional song (kīrtana) in Telugu composed by Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī,
  set to the Rāga Nīla, celebrating Jayalakṣmī as a manifestation of the supreme goddess
  Lakṣmī. The work comprises a pallavi (refrain) with seven numbered verses (anu­pallavi
  sections) followed by a detailed bhāva (philosophical commentary) that establishes
  correspondences between the family goddess Jayalakṣmī and the cosmic Lakṣmī, while
  instructing devotees on virtues of protection, compassion, and auspicious womanhood.
preamble: 'This kīrtana belongs to the Carnatic vocal devotional tradition, which
  uses classical Indian musical forms to express bhakti (devotion) toward Hindu deities.
  The song is dedicated to Jayalakṣmī, the household form of the goddess Lakṣmī venerated
  in South Indian temples and domestic worship. Ghanapāṭhī''s composition follows
  the conventional structure of Carnatic devotional music: a melodic framework (rāga),
  a poetic text combining Sanskrit and Telugu, and interpretive commentary (bhāva)
  that unfolds the theological and ethical dimensions of the deity''s attributes and
  grace toward worshippers.'
