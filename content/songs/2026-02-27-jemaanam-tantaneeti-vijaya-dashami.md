abstract: A devotional song (kīrtana) celebrating Vijayadaśamī, the tenth day of the
  lunar fortnight marking victory over evil in Hindu observance. The composition employs
  elaborate alliteration and metrical patterning in Telugu, invoking the Divine Mother
  as protector of warriors and kingdoms, with successive stanzas addressing her manifold
  forms and protective powers.
preamble: This work belongs to the kīrtana tradition of South Indian devotional music,
  particularly as developed in Telugu sacred composition. Vijayadaśamī (also called
  Daśaharā) commemorates the victory of Rāma over Rāvaṇa and Durgā over the buffalo
  demon, celebrated across Hindu communities as a festival of triumph over adharma
  (disorder). The song invokes the Divine Mother (Śakti) in her warrior and protective
  aspect, suitable for recitation during the festival period, and reflects the classical
  synthesis of Vedic invocation, Tamil-Kannada-Telugu prosodic conventions, and bhakti
  sensibility characteristic of Dr. Vamshi Krishna's compositional method.
