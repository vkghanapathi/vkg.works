abstract: A devotional hymn in Telugu composed in the ghanapāṭha style, addressing
  Jñānasāgara (the Ocean of Knowledge) as a supreme deity worthy of refuge. The work
  celebrates the deity's grace in dispelling ignorance and spiritual darkness, invoking
  blessings for wisdom, purification, and liberation through an auspicious lunar moment.
preamble: This composition belongs to the Telugu bhakti-devotional tradition and exemplifies
  the ghanapāṭha method of textual recitation and memorisation, a rigorous disciplinary
  practice rooted in Vedic scholarship. The work invokes Jñānasāgara within a framework
  of guru-disciple transmission (gurukula), wherein the removal of personal faults
  and the bestowal of sacred knowledge are presented as transformative grace. The
  text aligns with advaitic and tantric philosophical currents that emphasise the
  guru as an embodiment of primordial śakti (cosmic power) and the dispeller of avidyā
  (ignorance).
