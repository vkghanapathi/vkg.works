status: draft
abstract: A devotional song in Telugu addressed to Sri Anjaneya (Hanuman), structured
  in the traditional pallavi-anupallavi-charanam form. The composition employs Sanskrit-Telugu
  hybrid metres and celebrates the deity as the embodiment of *sat-chit-ananda* (being-consciousness-bliss),
  invoking his grace for the attainment of *vairagya* (dispassion) and spiritual steadiness.
  Dr. Ghanapāṭhī's metrical and linguistic exegesis demonstrates the integration of
  Vedic and Puranic theological concepts within classical Telugu song composition.
preamble: This work belongs to the tradition of Telugu devotional music rooted in
  the *bhakti* movement and the performance practices of classical South Indian vocal
  music (*sampradaya*). Hanuman, celebrated as the archetypal devotee and son of the
  wind-god (*Pavan-sunu*), occupies a central place in Ramayana-based theology and
  Vaishnava liturgy. The composition structures its praise through the three-part
  song form characteristic of *kriti* traditions, while the included Sanskrit and
  Telugu etymological commentary (*arthamu*) reflects the scholarly practice of explicating
  sacred texts through linguistic analysis—a method integral to Vedic exegesis and
  classical music pedagogy.
