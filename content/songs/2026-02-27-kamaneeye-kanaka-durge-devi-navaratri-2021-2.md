abstract: A devotional song composed in Telugu in the trisragati form, addressing
  Kanaka Durga (the golden goddess) with a structured list of petitions for household
  welfare, bodily strength, and spiritual knowledge. The work exemplifies the bhakti
  tradition's practice of votive composition, where the devotee articulates desires
  while simultaneously submitting them to divine will, culminating in a philosophical
  resolution that redirects personal longing toward the goddess herself.
preamble: This composition belongs to the Navaratri devotional cycle, specifically
  aligned with the Durga cult's worship during the nine-night festival of Devi Mahatmya
  observance in South Indian practice. The trisragati metrical framework (a triple-iteration
  form common in Telugu hymnic verse) structures the invocation of Kanaka Durga, a
  regional manifestation of the goddess worshipped in Andhra Pradesh, particularly
  near the Krishna River. The work combines the paean (pallavi and anubhava sections)
  with explicit desire-enumeration (kāmaṇa-patra) and philosophical reorientation,
  making it a hybrid devotional-wisdom text within the classical Telugu bhakti-sampradaya.
