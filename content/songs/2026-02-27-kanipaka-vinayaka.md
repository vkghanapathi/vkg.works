abstract: A devotional hymn in Telugu composed in the ghanapāṭha tradition, this work
  addresses Kānipāka Vināyaka (Gaṇeśa of Kānipāka) as the remover of obstacles and
  bestower of siddhis (occult powers). The text combines Sanskrit verse with Telugu
  philosophical exposition (bhāvamu) and two chraṇas (stanzas), narrating a foundational
  miracle wherein three disabled men—mute, blind, and lame—are healed through spontaneous
  worship of the deity's manifest form, illustrating divine grace operating through
  sincere devotion.
preamble: This work belongs to the śrī-vaiṣṇava and regional Andhra devotional traditions
  centred on Gaṇeśa worship at the sacred site of Kānipāka in Telangana. Composed
  in the ghanapāṭha idiom—a pedagogical musical-recitative form designed for memorization
  and performance—the hymn invokes the Vedantic notion of Sat-Chit-Ānanda (Being-Consciousness-Bliss)
  while remaining grounded in accessible regional theology. The work exemplifies the
  syncretic practice of invoking Sanskrit philosophical formulations within Telugu
  vernacular devotional contexts, common to post-medieval Andhra religious literature.
