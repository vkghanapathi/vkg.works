abstract: A sixteen-mantra invocational song (gīta) in Telugu composed by Dr. Vamshi
  Krishna Ghanapāṭhī that invokes Śodaśī (the Sixteen-syllable Goddess) in her triple-power
  manifestation for auspiciousness and protection. The work employs the classical
  pallavi-anupallavi-caraṇa structure of South Indian devotional music, integrating
  Śrī Vidyā sacred formulas (bījas) and divine names to create a ritualized mangala-kīrtana
  (auspicious hymn) suitable for worship and recitation.
preamble: This composition belongs to the Śrī Vidyā tantric tradition, a sophisticated
  system of Goddess worship centered on the veneration of Śodaśī (Tripurā Sundarī)
  as the supreme divine feminine principle. Śrī Vidyā emphasizes the sacred geometry
  of the Śrī Yantra and the esoteric power of mantra-syllables (bījas such as hrīṁ
  and oṁ) to invoke divine presence and grace. Dr. Ghanapāṭhī's composition follows
  the Navaratri (Nine Nights of the Goddess) observance tradition, specifically dated
  to Vikriti Saṁvatsara Śaraṇṇavaratri, positioning this mangala-gīta as a devotional
  vehicle for ritual invocation during sacred festival periods.
