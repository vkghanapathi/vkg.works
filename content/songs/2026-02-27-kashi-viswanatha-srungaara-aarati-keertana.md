abstract: A devotional liturgical composition in Telugu dedicated to Viśvanātha (Śiva)
  of Kāśī, structured as a sequence of ritual service songs (nīrājanam) that accompany
  the ceremonial worship and anointing of the deity. The work combines hymnic praise
  with detailed descriptions of ritual oblations (payasam, ghṛta, madhu) and symbolic
  ornamentation, exemplifying the integrated relationship between Sanskrit devotional
  aesthetics and vernacular Telugu religious practice in the Śaiva temple tradition.
preamble: This composition belongs to the Śaiva temple liturgy of Kāśī Viśvanātha,
  one of the most sacred pilgrimage sites in Hindu tradition. The text follows the
  framework of nīrājanam (ritual arati or waving of lights) and associated service
  songs performed during daily temple worship. Rooted in Tantric and Puranic Śaiva
  theology, these songs invoke Śiva in his manifestation as lord of Kāśī while performing
  concrete ritual actions—bathing with sacred substances, adorning with flowers and
  garlands, offering prepared foods, and illuminating the sanctum with ghee-fed lamps.
  The Telugu composition demonstrates how classical Sanskrit devotional conventions
  were integrated into regional vernacular religious literature, particularly in South
  Indian temple contexts where multilingual liturgical practice was normative.
