abstract: A devotional composition in Telugu celebrating the Kaveri River as a sacred
  manifestation embodying spiritual instruction, ritual purification, and divine grace.
  The work employs classical song structure (pallavi, anupallavi) with embedded Sanskrit
  verses to articulate the theological and ritual significance of the river within
  the Datta Guru tradition, specifically connecting the Kaveri to the incarnational
  presence of Dattātreya and the purification of sins through sacred immersion and
  ritual participation.
preamble: This work belongs to the bhajana or devotional song tradition of South Indian
  Hindu practice, specifically within the Datta Sampradāya (the lineage devoted to
  Dattātreya, a composite deity-guru embodying Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva). The Kaveri
  River holds paramount importance in Kannada and Telugu sacred geography, particularly
  in regions of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. The composition situates the river not merely
  as a geographical feature but as a living embodiment of guru-śakti (teaching power)
  and divine purification, drawing on Puranic narratives and Tantric philosophical
  frameworks where sacred waters serve as vehicles for both ritual and soteriological
  transformation.
