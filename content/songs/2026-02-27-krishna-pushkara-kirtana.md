abstract: A devotional composition in Telugu celebrating the Krishna River at Pushkara,
  composed in 2016 by Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī. The work combines ritual bathing
  instructions with cosmological and geographical praise, invoking the river's purificatory
  power through Sanskrit-Telugu hybrid versification and providing detailed exegetical
  commentary on each stanza's spiritual meaning.
preamble: This composition belongs to the Hindu devotional tradition of river praise
  (nadi-stuti) and participates in the Andhra regional veneration of the Krishna River
  as a sacred water body. Drawing on Puranic cosmology—particularly the concept of
  tirthas (pilgrimage sites) gathering within a single river—the work frames ritual
  bathing (snana-vidhi) as both physical and spiritual purification. The inclusion
  of astrological reference (Kanya rashi, Brihaspati) and invocation of mythological
  figures (Pushkar rishi) situates the composition within Smarta ritual practice and
  classical Sanskrit literary conventions adapted for Telugu devotional expression.
