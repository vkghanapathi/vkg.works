abstract: A devotional song cycle in Telugu presenting a comprehensive ethical framework
  for service to humanity and the divine. The work articulates six specific domains
  of seva (selfless service)—reverence toward gurus and elders, care for orphans and
  the vulnerable, education of youth, nourishment of the poor, healing of the sick,
  and support for the destitute—establishing service as the fundamental expression
  of spiritual practice within the Hindu life-stage system (āśrama).
preamble: This composition emerges from the bhakti and dharma-śāstra traditions of
  South Indian Hinduism, where service (seva) functions simultaneously as devotional
  practice and ethical obligation. Rooted in the Vedantic principle that divine presence
  inheres in all beings and the classical Hindu ethics of varṇāśrama-dharma (duty
  according to caste and life-stage), the work specifically invokes the ideal of vṛddha-āśrama
  (the stage of elder wisdom) and demonstrates how seva actualizes the concept of
  Viṣṇu present within human suffering. The composition reflects the broader Telugu
  devotional renaissance's synthesis of scriptural authority with social welfare imperatives.
