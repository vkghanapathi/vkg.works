abstract: A devotional composition celebrating Malleshvara (Mallikesvara), a self-manifested
  Shiva linga enshrined on a hill in the Vijayavada region, and its connection to
  the goddess Kanakadunga. The work integrates Puranic narrative—particularly the
  Kirata episode from the Mahabharata in which Arjuna performs austerities to obtain
  the Pasupata weapon while Shiva tests him in the guise of a hunter—with liturgical
  praise of the deity and his consort, presented as manifestations of Mahesvara and
  Durga.
preamble: This composition belongs to the Navaratri (Nine Nights) liturgical tradition,
  which celebrates the goddess Durga and her manifestations across nine days of worship.
  The work exemplifies the devotional theology of regional Shaiva Hinduism in Andhra
  Pradesh, where local shrine deities are understood as manifestations of the pan-Hindu
  cosmogonic pairs (Shiva-Parvati, Rudra-Girija). The Kirata narrative it invokes
  derives from the Mahabharata (Vana Parva) and was famously elaborated in Bharavi's
  Sanskrit epic Kiratarjuniya. Here, Dr. Vamshi Krishna integrates Vedantic philosophy
  (sat-chit-ananda consciousness) with place-specific mythology and ritual devotion.
