abstract: A devotional kīrtana (liturgical hymn) in three verses composed for the
  Hanumān temple at Dallas, set in tisragatī (triple-time musical metre). The composition
  invokes Hanumān through his manifestations and attributes—emerald-hued form, supreme
  protector, accomplisher of tasks—while integrating Vedic deities (Gaṇapati, Śiva,
  Rāghava) and philosophical concepts (sat-chit-ānanda, the triad of being-consciousness-bliss).
  It exemplifies the devotional music tradition of South Indian temple worship adapted
  to diaspora practice.
preamble: This kīrtana belongs to the Tamil-Kannada-Telugu devotional music tradition
  (bhakti saṅgīta), which has its roots in the classical compositions of South Indian
  Hindu temples. Hanumān worship, central to Rāmāyaṇa-based devotion and prominently
  developed in regional Hindu practice, here receives contemporary liturgical expression.
  The tisragatī metric form reflects classical Carnatic music principles applied to
  devotional language. The composition exemplifies how traditional Vedic and Purāṇic
  invocational structures are preserved and performed in modern diaspora temple contexts,
  maintaining scriptural authority while addressing contemporary communities.
