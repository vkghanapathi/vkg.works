status: draft
abstract: A devotional song in Telugu celebrating Śrī Rājarājeśvarī, the supreme Goddess,
  through elaborate descriptions of her emerald form, celestial abode, and cosmic
  manifestations across nine Durgā avatars. The work presents a comprehensive theological
  portrait integrating Śaiva, Śākta, and Vaiṣṇava elements, with detailed commentary
  explaining the symbolism of her divine retinue, architectural cosmology, and transcendent
  qualities beyond speech and mind.
preamble: This composition belongs to the Śākta devotional tradition of South India,
  specifically addressing Rājarājeśvarī (the Queen of Kings), a supreme manifestation
  of Śakti worshipped in the Śrīcakra tradition. The work draws upon the metaphysical
  framework of Tāntric Hinduism, particularly the Navacakra (nine-circle) cosmology
  and the Navadurgā (nine forms of Durgā) theology. The detailed prose commentary
  in Telugu, attributed to Dr. Vamshi Krishna's ghanapāṭhī tradition, interprets each
  verse through classical Sanskrit exegetical methods while maintaining accessibility
  for vernacular devotees.
