abstract: Mīnananyanā is a devotional song composition in Telugu that employs sophisticated
  phonetic patterning and alliterative devices characteristic of Ghanapāṭhī's analytical
  approach to classical song literature. The work addresses a divine or elevated figure
  through the metaphor of 'fish-eyed' beauty (mīnanayan) while exploring philosophical
  themes of wealth, virtue, and the distinctions between the worthy and unworthy through
  repeated vowel and consonant permutations. The composition demonstrates the integration
  of Vedic phonetic theory (śabdanusāra) with vernacular devotional song tradition.
preamble: This work belongs to the Telugu devotional song (padyam) tradition, which
  flourished in South India as a medium for both aesthetic expression and spiritual
  instruction. The text appears to engage with the broader Indian classical framework
  of rasa theory and alankāra (ornamentation), while maintaining close attention to
  the phonetic properties of language itself—a hallmark concern of Vedic hermeneutics.
  Through its layered wordplay and repetitive structure, the composition invites contemplation
  of moral and philosophical categories while functioning as a potential liturgical
  or meditative text within devotional practice.
