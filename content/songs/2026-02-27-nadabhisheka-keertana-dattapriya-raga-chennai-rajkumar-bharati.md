abstract: A multilingual devotional composition in the Dattapriyan raga dedicated
  to Sri Ganapatī Saccidānanda, the presiding deity of the Datta Pitha tradition.
  The work demonstrates sophisticated poetic and musical construction across Sanskrit,
  Telugu, Tamil, Kannada, and Hindi, structured according to classical Carnatic music
  form (pallavi, anupallavi, charanam) while exploring themes of guru devotion, liberation,
  and the transcendent nature of Saccidānanda consciousness.
preamble: This composition belongs to the Datta Pitha sampradaya, a non-dualistic
  Hindu tradition centered on the worship of Dattatreya and his successive incarnations,
  particularly Sri Ganapatī Saccidānanda (1809–1878). The work exemplifies the tradition's
  philosophical synthesis of Advaita Vedānta with devotional practice, wherein the
  guru is recognized as the embodiment of Saccidānanda (being-consciousness-bliss).
  The song functions as both a musical offering (raga-based composition) and a spiritual
  invocation, integrating regional vernacular languages with Sanskrit to make the
  guru's grace accessible across linguistic communities.
