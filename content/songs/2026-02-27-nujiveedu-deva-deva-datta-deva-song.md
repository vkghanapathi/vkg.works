abstract: This work is a fragment from a collection of devotional songs by Dr. Vamshi
  Krishna Ghanapāṭhī. The excerpt presents minimal textual content, appearing as a
  structural or editorial placeholder within the larger songs section, and requires
  contextualisation within the complete manuscript to establish its thematic and liturgical
  significance.
preamble: This piece belongs to the bhajana and kīrtana tradition of Hindu devotional
  music, where songs serve as vehicles for expressing devotion to the divine. Within
  South Indian classical and folk contexts, such compositions function both as spiritual
  practices and as pedagogical texts. Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī's work in this
  genre reflects the broader revival and scholarly documentation of vernacular devotional
  literature in Telugu, Kannada, and Sanskrit traditions, where song cycles preserve
  theological meaning and ritual application.
