abstract: A devotional kīrtana (song) composed by Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī commemorating
  a darśana (sacred viewing) of the Oṃkāreśvara Jyotirliṅga shrine on the Narmadā
  river during Māgha śuddha dvādaśī (twelfth lunar day of the bright fortnight of
  Māgha). The work contextualizes the shrine's mythological origins through the narrative
  of King Māndhātā of the Solar Dynasty and explicates the theological significance
  of Oṃ (Praṇava) as the fundamental principle of cosmic manifestation and liberation.
preamble: This work belongs to the Sanskrit and Telugu devotional lyric tradition
  of Śaiva pilgrimage and temple worship. Oṃkāreśvara is one of the twelve principal
  Jyotirliṅgas (luminous manifestations of Śiva) in Hindu sacred geography, situated
  on an island in the Narmadā river in central India. The kīrtana draws upon Vedic
  philosophy (particularly Upaniṣadic teachings on Oṃ as the gateway to Brahman),
  Purāṇic narratives of royal devotion, and Śaiva Advaita theology as transmitted
  through Śaṅkarācārya's monastic tradition. The genre combines historical-devotional
  narrative with philosophical instruction on mantra and liberation.
