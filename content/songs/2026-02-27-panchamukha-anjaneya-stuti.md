abstract: A devotional kīrtana (song of praise) composed in Telugu by Dr. Vamshi Krishna
  Ghanapāṭhī, centred on the five-faced (pañcamukha) form of Hanumān. The work employs
  the classical kīrtana structure (pallavi, anupallavi, charaṇa) to invoke five divine
  avatāras—Hayagrīva, Varāha, Vānara, Narasiṃha, and Garuḍa—through Hanumān's five
  faces, each representing different spiritual virtues and remedies for human weaknesses.
  The composition integrates Vedāntic philosophy with bhakti sentiment, mapping psychological
  and spiritual transformation onto mythological symbolism.
preamble: This work belongs to the South Indian kīrtana tradition, a form of devotional
  music and poetry deeply embedded in Hindu temple practice and Bhakti theology. Hanumān,
  the monkey-faced devotee of Rāma, holds paramount importance in Hindu religious
  practice as an emblem of devotion, courage, and spiritual discipline. The pañcamukha
  (five-faced) Hanumān is a form particularly venerated in Kerala and South Indian
  temples, where each face corresponds to a specific avatāra of Viṣṇu, thereby integrating
  cosmic divine manifestations into a single devotional figure. The kīrtana format,
  with its combination of Sanskrit and Telugu verse, melody, and explanatory prose
  (bhāva), serves as a vehicle for philosophical instruction alongside emotional engagement
  with divinity.
