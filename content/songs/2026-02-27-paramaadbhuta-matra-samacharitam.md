abstract: Paramādbhuta Mantra Samācharitam is a devotional song collection composed
  by Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī that celebrates the grace of Parameshvara (the
  Supreme Lord) moving through the world. The work exemplifies the integration of
  mantra-based devotionalism with narrative lyric composition, drawing on Tantric
  and Vedantic frameworks to express the transcendent power manifesting in terrestrial
  reality.
preamble: This collection belongs to the tradition of mantra-infused devotional poetry
  in Telugu, a practice rooted in Śaivism and Śakta Tantrism wherein sacred utterances
  (mantras) are embedded within song structures to amplify spiritual efficacy. The
  work reflects the South Indian bhakti and mantra-yoga synthesis, wherein the Supreme
  Principle (Parameshvara) is understood as the source of all grace (kripā) permeating
  creation. Such compositions serve both contemplative and ritualistic functions within
  Tantric-Vedantic circles, employing lyrical form to make esoteric knowledge accessible
  to practitioners.
