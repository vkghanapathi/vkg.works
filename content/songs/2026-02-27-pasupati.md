abstract: A musical composition in Telugu presenting a devotional song with notation
  indicating melodic phrases (svaras) and structural divisions. The work exemplifies
  the integration of Sanskrit musical terminology with Telugu vernacular composition,
  employing solfège syllables (sa, ri, ga, ma, pa) to guide vocal performance across
  multiple stanzas and a concluding section (caraṇam).
preamble: This composition belongs to the tradition of South Indian devotional music
  (bhajana or kīrtana), wherein Sanskrit musical notation systems were adapted for
  vernacular religious expression in Telugu. The use of svaranotation—the seven-note
  melodic system foundational to Hindustani and Carnatic classical music—reflects
  the historical practice of composers encoding melodic contours for congregational
  or formal performance. Such works typically functioned within temple worship, devotional
  gatherings, or formal recitation contexts where precise musical transmission was
  essential for preserving both the text and its intended melodic shape.
