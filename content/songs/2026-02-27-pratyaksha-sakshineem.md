abstract: A devotional song addressed to the goddess Meenakshi, presenting her as
  the eternal witness (sākṣiṇī) to all creation. The work employs elaborate Sanskrit-Telugu
  wordplay centred on the root 'akṣ-' (eye, witness, indestructible) to articulate
  the goddess's transcendent nature as simultaneously the sustainer of dharma, the
  source of philosophical knowledge, and the object of devotional meditation.
preamble: 'This composition belongs to the Śaiva-Śakta devotional tradition of South
  India, specifically the worship of Meenakshi (Mīnākṣī) at the Minakshi Temple in
  Madurai. The work draws on classical Tamil and Telugu poetic conventions while employing
  Vedantic philosophy and the Maheśvara Sūtra tradition of Sanskrit phonology. It
  reflects the dual nature of the goddess in Hindu theology: as Pārvatī (the mountain-born
  consort of Śiva) and as the cosmic creative principle (Śakti) who witnesses and
  sustains the manifest universe.'
