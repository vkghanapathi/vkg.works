abstract: A devotional song in Telugu dedicated to Pratyaṅgirā, a fierce form of the
  Divine Mother, composed in classical kīrtana structure with pallavi, anupallavi,
  and charaṇa sections. The composition invokes the goddess in her transcendent and
  immanent aspects, depicting her iconography and power to annihilate inner and outer
  obstacles, and is exemplary of Śaiva-Śākta devotional literature in South Indian
  classical music tradition.
preamble: This work belongs to the Śaiva-Śākta devotional tradition of South India,
  specifically addressing Pratyaṅgirā, a manifestation of Śakti venerated in tantric
  and classical Hindu worship. Pratyaṅgirā is understood as a protective and fierce
  form of divine feminine energy, associated with the destruction of negative forces
  and the liberation of the devotee. The composition follows the traditional kīrtana
  format used in classical Indian music performance, making it both a spiritual invocation
  and an aesthetic liturgical text. The work exemplifies how Dr. Ghanapāṭhī engages
  classical Sanskrit poetic conventions and theological imagery within the vernacular
  Telugu medium.
