abstract: Khaṇḍa Gati is a devotional song sequence celebrating Lord Rāma through
  invocation, mantra recitation, and narrative commemoration of his divine deeds.
  The work combines Vedic mantra elements with bhakti sentiment, tracing Rāma's life
  from his birth through his victory over Rāvaṇa and his establishment of dharma,
  culminating in praise of the liberatory power of Rāma's name.
preamble: This work belongs to the Telugu devotional song tradition within Vaiṣṇava
  Hinduism, specifically the Rāma-centred branch of bhakti practice. It draws on the
  Rāmāyaṇa narrative and Vedic mantric traditions, employing the sacred formula 'Rāma'
  as both object of meditation and instrument of liberation. The composition reflects
  the practice of nama-jāpa (repetition of the divine name) and dhyāna (meditative
  devotion) characteristic of South Indian devotional Hinduism, where the recitation
  and contemplation of Rāma's name and deeds are understood as paths to spiritual
  liberation and eternal bliss.
