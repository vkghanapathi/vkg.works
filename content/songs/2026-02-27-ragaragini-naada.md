title: రాగరాగిణీ నాద చికిత్సక
date: '2026-02-27'
author: Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī
status: draft
abstract: A devotional composition in Telugu that presents nāda (sound/music) as a
  therapeutic and spiritual principle, invoking the healing and liberating power of
  sound across multiple knowledge systems including astronomy, medicine, and philosophy.
  The work celebrates the transmission of rāga (melodic mode) knowledge through the
  Vēṅkaṭa lineage of pandits, positioning nāda as the instrument of ultimate realization
  (Brahman consciousness) and soteriological transformation.
preamble: This work belongs to the Sanskrit and Telugu musical-devotional literature
  tradition that treats sound (nāda) as a metaphysical principle rooted in Vedic cosmology
  and non-dualistic philosophy. Drawing on Sāṃkhya metaphysics, classical rāga theory,
  and the Sanskrit medical and astronomical canons, the composition situates music
  (saṃgīta) within a comprehensive epistemic framework where auditory science, therapeutics,
  and liberation converge. The invocation of the Vēṅkaṭa pandita lineage anchors the
  work in South Indian Brahminical scholarly tradition, particularly the preservation
  and transmission of rāga classification systems (such as the seventy-two mēlakartās)
  and their soteriological applications.
