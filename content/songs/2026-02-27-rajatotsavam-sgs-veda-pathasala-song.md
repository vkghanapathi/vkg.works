abstract: A devotional song cycle in Sanskrit and Telugu honouring Śrī Gaṇapati Saccidānanda
  Veda Pāṭhaśālā (a Vedic school), comprising three numbered verses that invoke blessings
  for the institution's prosperity and articulate the cosmological and soteriological
  significance of the Vedas in Hindu dharma and universal peace. The work integrates
  ritual invocation, institutional eulogy, and philosophical reflection on Vedic knowledge
  as the root remedy for human suffering and the foundation of spiritual enlightenment.
preamble: This composition belongs to the genre of institutional praise-songs (stuti)
  within the broader Hindu devotional and pedagogical tradition. The pāṭhaśālā (Vedic
  school) named after Gaṇapati Saccidānanda represents the continuing lineage of Vedic
  preservation and transmission in South India. The text invokes Gaṇeśa (Gaṇapati),
  the remover of obstacles, as the presiding deity of learning, while celebrating
  the Vedas as the eternal epistemic and ethical foundation (śāstra) of Indian religion.
  The bilingual composition in Sanskrit and Telugu reflects the multilingual scholastic
  culture of South Indian Vedic institutions.
