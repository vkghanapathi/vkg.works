title: నవరాత్రి 21.9 (మంగళం)
date: '2026-02-27'

status: draft
abstract: A devotional song cycle composed for Navaratri (the nine-night festival
  honoring the Divine Mother) that systematically invokes 21 attributes of the Goddess
  through the repeated refrain मंगळं (maṅgaḷam, 'auspiciousness'). The work pairs
  Sanskrit epithets derived from Lalitā Sahasranāma (the thousand names of Lalitā)
  with detailed Telugu glosses that explain the philosophical significance of each
  attribute, functioning simultaneously as liturgical verse and exegetical commentary
  on non-dual Vedānta doctrine.
preamble: This composition belongs to the Śāktā tradition of Hindu devotionalism,
  specifically the worship of Durgā and Rājeśvarī during the autumnal Navaratri festival.
  Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī's work draws from the Lalitā Sahasranāma, a classical
  Sanskrit stotra traditionally recited to invoke the Goddess in her transcendent
  and immanent forms. The repeated enumeration of divine attributes—each qualified
  by the prefix nir- (without) or niṣ- (devoid of)—establishes a progressive theological
  framework grounded in Advaita Vedānta philosophy, wherein the Goddess is understood
  as Parābrahmā (Supreme Brahman) possessed of no limitations, divisions, or phenomenal
  characteristics. The Telugu commentary serves to make this esoteric wisdom accessible
  to vernacular practitioners.
