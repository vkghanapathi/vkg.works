abstract: A devotional song cycle in Telugu honouring Śrī Rāma, composed in the Śaṅkarābharaṇam
  rāga within the miśragati (mixed-metre) form. The eight stanzas celebrate Rāma's
  divine attributes—his adherence to dharma, protection of devotees, mastery over
  passion and delusion, universal compassion, wisdom, and the bestowal of spiritual
  liberation—positioning him as the supreme principle (Brahman) embodied in human
  form.
preamble: This work belongs to the South Indian classical devotional tradition (bhakti),
  specifically the Telugu-language carnatic vocal repertoire. Śaṅkarābharaṇam is a
  foundational rāga in Hindustani and Carnatic music, traditionally associated with
  morning performance and ascetic contemplation. The miśragati (mixed-metre) structure
  allows rhythmic and melodic flexibility suited to extended devotional meditation.
  The song embeds itself within the broader Hindu philosophical framework of Rāma
  worship as articulated in the Rāmāyaṇa and Vedāntic theology, particularly the Advaita
  Vedānta school associated with Śaṅkara, whose name the rāga honours.
