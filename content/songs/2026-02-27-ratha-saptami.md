abstract: A devotional hymn composed within the framework of Ratha Saptami vrata (the
  seventh-day chariot festival honoring the Sun deity), this work celebrates Surya
  Narayana through praise of his cosmological functions and soteriological benefits.
  The composition invokes the Sun as the dispeller of disease, fear, and misfortune,
  while acknowledging his universal sovereignty across the three worlds and his role
  as the source of eternal consciousness (Sat-Chit-Ananda).
preamble: Ratha Saptami is a Hindu votive observance dedicated to Surya (the Sun god),
  traditionally observed in the month of Magha and centered on ritual worship, fasting,
  and devotional recitation. This Telugu-language composition forms part of the vrata-sadhana
  (ritual fulfillment) literature, which combines Puranic mythology with practical
  religious instruction. The hymn follows established conventions of Sun worship in
  Hindu devotional practice, particularly as systematized in post-classical Bhakti
  traditions, wherein the solar deity embodies both cosmological necessity and salvific
  grace.
