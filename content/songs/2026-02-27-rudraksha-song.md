abstract: A devotional song in Telugu on the spiritual significance and ritual practices
  associated with Rudraksha beads, attributed to Śiva. The work comprises four verses
  (caraṇas) followed by interpretive prose commentary (bhāvamu), detailing the mythological
  origin of Rudraksha from Śiva's tears, enumerating the varieties and their auspicious
  properties, and prescribing their wear as a means of spiritual protection and liberation.
preamble: This composition belongs to the Śaiva devotional tradition, specifically
  addressing the veneration and use of Rudraksha beads—sacred seeds associated with
  Lord Śiva in Hindu religious practice. Rudraksha beads form a central element of
  Śaiva ritual and meditative discipline, and their wear is prescribed across multiple
  Purāṇic and Tantric texts. The work situates Rudraksha within cosmological mythology,
  connecting their origin to Śiva's intervention against the demon Tripurāsura, and
  provides both spiritual rationale and practical guidance for their adoption by devotees
  seeking material welfare (bhukti) and spiritual liberation (mukti).
