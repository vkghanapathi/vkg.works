abstract: Sadguru Labdhiḥ is a devotional song cycle in Telugu that celebrates the
  attainment of a true spiritual preceptor (sadguru) as the ultimate grace and transformative
  blessing. Through four verses employing Vedantic concepts and imagery, the work
  articulates the irreplaceable role of the guru in spiritual realization, contrasting
  mere textual learning with the direct transmission of non-dual wisdom.
preamble: This work belongs to the Telugu devotional and philosophical tradition that
  synthesizes Vedantic teachings with bhakti sentiment. Rooted in the Upaniṣadic tradition
  and the advaita-vedānta philosophy of non-duality, the composition emphasizes the
  guru-disciple relationship as central to spiritual liberation (mokṣa). The work
  draws on classical Sanskrit aphorisms—particularly 'Tat tvam asi' (Thou art That)
  from the Chāndogya Upaniṣad—while rendering them in vernacular Telugu poetry, making
  abstract philosophical truths accessible through devotional expression. The guru-centric
  theology reflects the living tradition of North Indian and South Indian Hindu spirituality
  where the enlightened master serves as the indispensable mediator of transcendent
  knowledge.
