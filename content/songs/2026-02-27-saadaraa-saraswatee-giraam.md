abstract: A devotional song in Telugu dedicated to Saraswatī, the goddess of knowledge,
  wisdom, and learning. The composition employs classical Sanskrit-Telugu hybridity
  and employs the pallavi-verse structure common to South Indian musical compositions,
  invoking the deity's blessing for intellectual clarity and spiritual attainment.
preamble: This work belongs to the devotional song tradition of South Indian classical
  music and Telugu sacred literature, wherein deity-focused hymns form part of both
  liturgical practice and philosophical instruction. Saraswatī, venerated across Hindu
  traditions as the consort of Brahmā and custodian of Vedic knowledge, is here addressed
  through multiple epithets—Gīrā-Devatā (Goddess of Speech), Brahmānī, and Bhāmatī—emphasizing
  her role as the presiding deity of learning, articulation, and transcendent wisdom.
  The invocation of her as Aimā-Bīja-Āvasinī (Dweller in the Seed-Mantra 'Aim') and
  Sad-Vidyā-Dāyinī (Bestower of True Knowledge) situates this song within both tantric
  and Vedantic philosophical frameworks prevalent in classical Sanskrit and Telugu
  religious compositions.
