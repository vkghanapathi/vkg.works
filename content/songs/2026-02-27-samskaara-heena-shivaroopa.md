abstract: A devotional song (khanda gati, or irregular metre composition) in Telugu
  honouring Dattatreya, the composite form of Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva. The work
  contrasts the uncultured (samskara-hina) with the cultivated devotee, invoking Dattatreya's
  grace for liberation (kaivalya) and spiritual transformation through proper observance.
preamble: This composition belongs to the bhakti song tradition of South Indian Hindu
  devotionalism, specifically addressing Dattatreya (Dattātreya), a major avatar revered
  across multiple philosophical schools including Advaita Vedanta and Shaiva traditions.
  Dattatreya represents the unified principle of Brahman embodied in human form and
  is worshipped as a guru-deity who grants both worldly refinement and ultimate liberation.
  The invocation of 'Shiva-rupa' (Shiva-form) aligns with the nondual understanding
  of divinity central to Vedantic philosophy. The song's metre and structure reflect
  the khandagati style, a flexible rhythmic mode used in South Indian musical compositions
  for devotional purposes.
