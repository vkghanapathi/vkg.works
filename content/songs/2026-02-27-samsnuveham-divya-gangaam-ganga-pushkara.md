abstract: A devotional song in Telugu composed in the Mīśra Chāpu tāḷam (mixed rhythmic
  cycle), this work presents a systematic praise of the Ganges (Gaṅgā) as a sacred
  mother figure emerging from the feet of Viṣṇu. Through three characterisations (pallavi,
  anupallavi, and three caraṇams), the composition weaves together mythological narratives,
  cosmological geography, and soteriological claims central to Ganges worship in Hindu
  tradition, culminating in the doctrine of tīrtha-confluence and the production of
  amṛta (divine nectar) through ritual immersion.
preamble: This composition belongs to the devotional music tradition (bhajana) of
  South Indian Hinduism, specifically employing the metrical and melodic conventions
  of Carnatic music. The Ganges (Gaṅgā or Jāhnavī) occupies a pivotal position in
  Hindu cosmology and ritual practice as the foremost tīrtha (sacred pilgrimage site)
  and purificatory agent. This song synthesizes Purāṇic mythology—particularly the
  descent of the Ganges from Viṣṇu's feet and its capture by King Jahnu—with liturgical
  and astrological references (such as the twelve-yearly confluence of Ganges and
  Pushkar during Jupiter's transit through Aries) central to Kumbha Melā observance
  and ritual bathing practices.
