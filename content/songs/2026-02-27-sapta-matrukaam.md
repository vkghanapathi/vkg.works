abstract: This Telugu devotional song presents a liturgical invocation of the Saptamātṛkā
  (Seven Mothers), a central goddess group in Hindu tantric and Śaiva theology. The
  work progresses through enumeration of the seven divine mothers—Brāhmī, Māheśvarī,
  Kaumārī, Vaiṣṇavī, Vārāhī, Nārasīṁhī, and Aindrī—before transitioning into a heartfelt
  petition for devotional steadfastness, righteousness, and spiritual knowledge, culminating
  in a personal invocation of the goddess as protectress.
preamble: This composition belongs to the Śaiva-Śakta devotional tradition of South
  India, wherein the Saptamātṛkā or Matṛkādevī group occupies a significant position
  in both temple ritual and meditative practice. The seven mothers, each associated
  with a principal male deity of the Hindu pantheon, are venerated collectively as
  cosmic powers (śaktis) and manifestations of the supreme feminine principle. In
  Telugu literary tradition, such invocatory songs function as both liturgical texts
  for daily worship and as philosophical meditations on divine grace and maternal
  protection. Dr. Ghanapāṭhī's composition exemplifies the classical Telugu devotional
  mode while maintaining the technical precision expected of Vedic chant specialists.
