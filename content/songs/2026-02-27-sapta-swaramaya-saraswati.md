abstract: చતురస్ర గతి (Chaturasra Gati) is a devotional song in Telugu composed by
  Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī that celebrates Saraswati as the embodiment of the
  seven musical notes and sacred sound (nāda). The work integrates classical Karnatic
  music theory—including the twelve stations of sound (sthāna), ragas, and melodic
  ornamentations—with Vedantic philosophy and yogic praxis, presenting music as a
  pathway to spiritual realization and divine knowledge.
preamble: This composition belongs to the tradition of bhakti music in Telugu, specifically
  addressing Saraswati (the goddess of learning, music, and speech) as an object of
  worship through sound and musical practice. It draws from the Sāmaveda (known for
  its melodic chanting tradition), Indian classical music theory, and Advaitic philosophy.
  The work reflects a pan-Hindu devotional approach wherein the cultivation of musical
  knowledge and vocal discipline (sādhana) serves as a means of liberation (mokṣa)
  and union with the divine. The textual tradition of explaining the deeper meanings
  (bhāva) of such compositions is central to Vedantic interpretation.
