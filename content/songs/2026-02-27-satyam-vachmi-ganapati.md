title: గణపతి - 2  (గణపతి మంత్ర కీర్తనలలో రెండవది)
date: '2026-02-27'

status: draft
abstract: Ganapatī - 2 is the second composition in Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī's
  series of Ganapatī mantra kīrtanas (devotional songs to Lord Ganesha). Structured
  in tisr agati (triple rhythmic metre), the piece comprises two numbered stanzas
  that invoke Ganesha's omnipresence—north, south, east, west, above, and below—while
  affirming his identity as Brahman and celebrating his essential nature as sat-cit-ānanda
  (being, consciousness, bliss). The work demonstrates classical South Indian devotional
  and Vedic philosophical integration within the contemporary kīrtana genre.
preamble: This composition belongs to the Hindu devotional tradition of kīrtana (rhythmic
  chanting of devotional lyrics), specifically dedicated to Ganesha (Vināyaka), the
  remover of obstacles venerated in both Vedic and Purāṇic traditions. The work draws
  upon Vedantic philosophy, invoking Ganesha as Brahmaspati (the Lord of sacred speech)
  and identifying the deity with non-dual Brahman. Performed during Ganesha festival
  observances (Vināyaka Chaviti), such kīrtanas serve as both spiritual discipline
  and devotional practice within the Vedic-Purāṇic continuum of South Indian worship.
  The companion piece (Ganapatī - 1) employs the rāga Malayamārutam and shares similar
  philosophical and liturgical concerns.
