abstract: A devotional hymn in Telugu composed in four verses plus interpretive commentary,
  addressed to Śakti-Durgā as the supreme divine feminine principle. The work integrates
  Śākta theology with Advaitic philosophy, presenting worship of the goddess as the
  path to liberation through transcendence of ignorance and the dissolution of desire.
preamble: Tisr̥gati belongs to the bhakti-devotional song tradition within Hindu Śākta
  worship, specifically venerating Durgā and Kālī as manifestations of cosmic Śakti.
  The composition reflects the theological framework wherein the goddess is recognized
  as the repository of all Vedic knowledge and the active principle (śakti) sustaining
  divine function (devakārya). The work integrates concepts from Advaita Vedānta—particularly
  the equation of Praṇava (Om) with liberation and the transcendence of ignorance
  (ajñāna)—with devotional surrender (bhakti) to the goddess form.
