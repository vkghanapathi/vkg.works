abstract: A devotional song in Telugu composed in classical padya structure (pallavi,
  anupallavi, and charaṇa) celebrating the sacred golden threshold of Govinda's temple
  and the spiritual transformation it affords the devotee. The work expresses ecstatic
  religious experience through the metaphor of entering the deity's sanctum, culminating
  in the recognition that temple access itself constitutes the fullness of blessed
  existence.
preamble: This composition belongs to the Telugu devotional lyric tradition (bhakti
  padya), specifically addressing the iconography and ritual geography of a Viṣṇu
  temple dedicated to Govinda. The song draws on the Hindu temple's liturgical architecture—the
  gopuram (gateway tower), the flag-post pediment (dhvaja-stambha), and the inner
  sanctum—as stations of grace. The work reflects the broader Śrīvaiṣṇava theological
  framework in which temple darśana (vision of the deity) and physical proximity to
  sacred spaces constitute paths to mokṣa. Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī's composition
  exemplifies the modern continuation of classical Telugu devotional song-craft.
