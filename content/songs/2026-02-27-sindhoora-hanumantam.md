title: సింధూర హనుమన్త మారాధయే
date: '2026-02-27'

status: draft
abstract: A devotional song sequence dedicated to Hanumān (Āñjaneyudu) in his manifestation
  as Sindhūra Hanumān, composed by Dr. Vamshi Krishna as a work of rāga-based worship.
  The composition interweaves musical theory (rāga and tāla) with bhakti philosophy,
  exploring how devotional practice through sound and rhythm leads the worshipper
  from emotional attachment (rāga as passion) toward transcendent realization (anāhata
  nāda-siddhi). The work exemplifies the Vedantic principle of nāda-brahman (sound
  as absolute reality) through the lens of Hanumān worship.
preamble: This work belongs to the Hindu devotional tradition of rāga-upāsanā, wherein
  classical Indian musical modes (rāgas) and rhythmic cycles (tālas) function as vehicles
  for meditation and worship. Hanumān, the paradigmatic devoted follower in the Rāmāyaṇa
  tradition, is here invoked in his association with cinnabar-red stone idols (sindhūra),
  a form consecrated by Sri Swamiji at the Dattanātha temple in Guntur. The composition
  synthesizes Vedantic metaphysics, musicological terminology, and lyrical devotion,
  positioning the worshipper's sonic practice as a means of transcending conditional
  attachment while cultivating permanent spiritual stability (tāla as pratiṣṭhā, foundational
  permanence).
