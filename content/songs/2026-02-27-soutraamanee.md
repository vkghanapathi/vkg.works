status: draft
abstract: A devotional song sequence (pada) in Telugu addressed to the goddess Kāmākṣī,
  comprising two verses (anupallavi and charanam) that elaborate on her cosmic functions
  as the Sakti underlying creation and preservation. The work employs intricate wordplay
  and philosophical commentary to reconcile Tantric theology with Vedantic metaphysics,
  presenting the goddess's eyes and protective faculties as manifestations of Brahman
  operating across multiple planes of existence.
preamble: This composition belongs to the Sri Vaishnava and Sakta devotional traditions
  of South India, specifically addressing Kāmākṣī of Kanchipuram, one of the principal
  Mahavidyas in the Hindu pantheon. The work integrates Upanishadic philosophy (Sat-Chit-Ananda
  doctrine), Tantric concepts of Shakti as the dynamic principle of the cosmos, and
  the classical Indian understanding of prana (vital force) and chakras. The accompanying
  bhāvamu (philosophical gloss) provides exegesis typical of Ghanapāṭhī's pedagogical
  method, connecting mythological symbolism to cosmological and physiological principles
  recognized across Vedantic and yogic traditions.
