abstract: This devotional hymn celebrates Lord Rāma through a sequence of epithets
  and narrative episodes from the Rāmāyaṇa, each line culminating in the refrain 'Jaya
  Jayarāma' (Victory to Rāma). The composition systematically invokes Rāma's genealogy,
  divine attributes, principal relationships, and transformative deeds—from his birth
  as Daśaratha's son through his exile, heroic conquests, and establishment of righteous
  rule—functioning as both a praise-poem and a meditational aid within Vaiṣṇava devotional
  practice.
preamble: This work belongs to the tradition of Bhakti devotionalism centred on Rāma,
  the seventh avatāra of Viṣṇu and protagonist of the Sanskrit epic Rāmāyaṇa. In South
  Indian Hindu practice, particularly within Telugu-speaking regions, such dhyana-stotras
  (meditation hymns) serve as vehicles for concentrated veneration and recollection
  of divine narrative. The refrain-based structure permits both group chanting and
  individual contemplative practice, embedding doctrinal and mythic content within
  accessible, rhythmic form. This mode of composition reflects centuries of Sanskrit
  and vernacular devotional poetry traditions that prioritise the experiential and
  relational dimensions of deity-worship alongside philosophical understanding.
