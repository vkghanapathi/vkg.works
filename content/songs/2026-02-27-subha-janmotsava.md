abstract: A devotional song (bhajan) celebrating an auspicious birthday, invoking
  blessings from Swami Ganapati Sacchidananda and the guru lineage of Sri Guru Dattatreya.
  The work demonstrates Dr. Ghanapāṭhī's engagement with contemporary Hindu devotional
  practice, combining invocations to multiple divine and guru forms within a single
  celebratory composition.
preamble: This composition belongs to the bhajan tradition of Hindu devotional song,
  widely practised in South Indian spiritual communities. It centres on the veneration
  of Swami Ganapati Sacchidananda, a 20th-century spiritual master, alongside the
  ancient guru principle embodied in Dattatreya, a revered figure in Natha and Advaita
  traditions. The work reflects the living guru-bhakti (devotion to the teacher) lineage
  that remains central to Telugu-speaking Hindu spiritual practice, particularly within
  ashram-based communities. The repeated invocation of titles such as Appaji (father/guru)
  and Swamiji situates the composition within a framework of intimate, familial relationship
  to the divine through the guru.
