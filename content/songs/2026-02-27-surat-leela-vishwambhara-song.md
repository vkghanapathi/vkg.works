abstract: A devotional song (bhaja) addressed to Dattātreya, the syncretistic sage-deity
  revered across Hindu, Buddhist, and Nāth traditions, specifically invoking his manifestation
  as Līlā-Viśwambhara at Sūrat on the Tapti River in Gujarat. The composition employs
  classical Telugu musical and poetic structures (pallavi, anupallavi, charaṇam) to
  teach the spiritual disciplines of discipleship, mental purification, and the guru-disciple
  relationship through narrative exemplifications of the deity's testing of devotees.
preamble: This work participates in the bhakti devotional tradition of South India,
  adapted into Telugu-language devotional poetry. Dattātreya—regarded as an incarnation
  embodying Brahmā, Viṣṇu, and Śiva—holds particular significance in Nāth yoga philosophy
  and Advaita Vedānta circles. The song invokes Dattātreya's aspect as Līlā-Viśwambhara
  ('play-sustainer'), emphasizing his divine sport (līlā) as pedagogical instrument.
  The work's three-verse structure with interpretive prose commentary (bhāvamu) reflects
  the didactic songbook tradition established by composers like Tyāgarāja and Kshetrayya
  in Telugu devotional literature.
