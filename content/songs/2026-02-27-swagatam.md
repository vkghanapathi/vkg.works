abstract: A devotional song of welcome and praise (स्वागतम्) composed in Telugu, celebrating
  Dattātreya as the supreme guru, embodiment of Brahman, and establisher of the Dattapīṭha
  tradition. The composition employs classical musical form (Haṃsadhvani rāga, ādi
  tāla) to invoke the deity's role as dispenser of the eight supernatural perfections
  (aṣṭasiddhi), guardian of dharma, and liberator of the afflicted.
preamble: This work belongs to the bhakti-kīrtana tradition of South Indian devotional
  practice, specifically within the Dattapīṭha sampradāya—a monastic order venerating
  Dattātreya as an incarnation of the Trimurti and supreme spiritual preceptor. The
  song follows classical Carnatic music conventions (rāga-tāla framework) and structured
  lyric composition (pallavi, anupallavi, caraṇa), making it suitable for both liturgical
  recitation and public devotional performance. Its theological emphasis on Dattātreya
  as both transcendent consciousness (Sat-Chit-Ānanda) and immanent guide reflects
  the philosophical synthesis characteristic of Datta tradition theology.
