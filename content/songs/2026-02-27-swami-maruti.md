abstract: Prathama Charaṇam is a eight-stanza devotional hymn addressed to Hanumān
  (Maruti), the monkey deity venerated as the supreme devotee of Rāma in the Hindu
  tradition. The composition employs elaborate Sanskrit and Telugu poetic forms to
  invoke Hanumān's protective grace, emphasizing his role as cosmic guardian, remover
  of sin, and upholder of dharma across multiple cosmological dimensions.
preamble: This work belongs to the tradition of bhakti hymnography centered on Hanumān,
  a central figure in the Rāmāyaṇa epic and Vaiṣṇava devotional practice. Hanumān
  is revered not merely as a character in epic narrative but as an embodiment of absolute
  devotion, courage, and moral steadfastness. The hymn invokes traditional epithets
  and attributes—Hanumān as lokapālaka (world-protector), as the messenger (dūta)
  of Rāma, and as the symbol of unwavering bhakti. The composition follows a structured
  stanzaic pattern (charaṇam), a classical form in Dravidian and Sanskrit devotional
  verse, wherein each stanza develops thematic elaborations on the deity's cosmic
  functions, intimate relationship with the devotee, and salvific powers.
