abstract: Gaman Śrama is a devotional song composition that employs intricate phonetic
  and semantic play through repetition and permutation of Sanskrit syllables and roots.
  The work demonstrates advanced techniques of word-sound correlation characteristic
  of Ghanapāṭhī's scholarly approach, where sonic patterns generate layers of meaning
  related to movement (gaman), meditation (samādhāna), and ultimate reality (sat-chit-ānanda).
preamble: This composition belongs to the devotional and contemplative song tradition
  of Indian classical literature, where poetic form serves both aesthetic and spiritual
  functions. Rooted in the Vedantic philosophical framework that understands consciousness
  (chit) and bliss (ānanda) as fundamental principles of reality, Gaman Śrama exemplifies
  the integration of linguistic precision with mystical expression. The work reflects
  Dr. Ghanapāṭhī's distinctive methodology of employing systematic phonetic variation
  (ghanapāṭha) to encode multiple layers of sacred meaning within a single composition.
