abstract: A bilingual devotional composition in Sanskrit and Telugu that celebrates
  the Divine Mother through repetitive invocational phrases structured around the
  number three (tri-), a sacred numeral in Hindu metaphysics. The work demonstrates
  Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī's mastery of polyglot composition and his integration
  of classical Sanskrit mantric language with vernacular Telugu devotion, employing
  numerical symbolism and phonetic parallelism characteristic of Ghanapāṭhī recitation
  traditions.
preamble: This song belongs to the Śakta devotional tradition, which venerates the
  Divine Mother (Devī/Śakti) as the supreme principle of cosmic energy and consciousness.
  The composition draws on Sanskrit philosophical categories—particularly the trimūrti
  (three forms), triguṇa (three qualities of nature), and triloka (three worlds)—while
  incorporating Telugu poetic forms. The bilingual structure reflects the classical
  South Indian scholarly practice of composing simultaneously in Sanskrit and regional
  languages, and the invocational repetitions echo the mantric meditation practices
  central to Tantric and classical Devī worship. The concluding formula सच्चिदानन्ददा
  (sat-chit-ānanda-dā, 'bestower of being-consciousness-bliss') anchors the work in
  Advaita Vedānta metaphysics.
