title: "పల్లవి\t\t\t\tరాగం ఖరహర ప్రియ\t తిస్రగతి"
date: '2026-02-27'
author: Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī
status: draft
abstract: A devotional pallavi (opening verse) in Khara Hara Priya raga set to tisragatī
  (triple-time metric pattern), addressing Mahākāla (Śiva) and Kālikā (the Goddess
  in her fierce form). The composition develops a philosophical meditation on the
  nature of time (kāla), death, and liberation through the sacred geography of Ujjayinī
  and the esoteric symbolism of ashes (vibhūti), culminating in the realization of
  the eternal self beyond temporal succession.
preamble: This work belongs to the Carnatic music devotional tradition, specifically
  the compositions attributed to Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī. It draws on Tantric
  and Advaitic philosophical frameworks, invoking the non-dual nature of Mahākāla
  and Kālikā—two forms central to Śaiva worship and Tantric practice. The composition
  employs classical Sanskrit with Telugu phonetic representation, situating itself
  within the scholarly-devotional genre that synthesizes Vedantic philosophy with
  the affective devotion (bhakti) characteristic of South Indian musical and religious
  praxis.
