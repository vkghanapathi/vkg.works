status: draft
abstract: A devotional song in Telugu honouring Lord Venkateśvara at the Uttara Tirupati
  shrine, accompanied by a detailed mangala-āśāsana (auspicious invocation) that identifies
  the presiding deity within a sacred geography of attending divinities. The work
  combines lyrical verse with benedictory prose, invoking blessings of prosperity,
  health, courage, and longevity upon the assembled devotees.
preamble: This composition belongs to the South Indian Śaivite and Vaiṣṇava devotional
  tradition (bhakti), specifically addressing the sacred pilgrimage site of Uttara
  Tirupati. The work follows the convention of the mangala-āśāsana—a formal blessing
  prayer that identifies the temple's presiding deity (Venkateśvara) in relation to
  his divine attendants (Hanumān, Ganeśa, Dattātreya, and Padmāvatī) and celebrates
  the spiritual potency of the shrine. Such compositions serve both liturgical and
  communal functions within temple worship, reinforcing the sanctity of place and
  the efficacy of devotional service.
