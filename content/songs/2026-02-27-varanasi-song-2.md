abstract: A four-stanza devotional hymn (pallavi) in Telugu celebrating Lord Śiva
  in his multiple aspects and manifestations, particularly as Viśveśvara (the Lord
  of all worlds) enshrined at Vārāṇasī. The composition integrates invocations of
  Śiva's cosmic attributes, sacred geography, ritual worship practices, and philosophical
  themes of liberation through theological devotion.
preamble: This pallavi belongs to the Śaiva bhakti tradition and functions as a liturgical
  song for temple worship and contemplative recitation. Phallavis are structural song-units
  in Carnatic music and devotional practice, typically featuring repeating or cycling
  melodic and textual patterns. The work invokes Śiva as Soma, Rudra, Śaṅkara, and
  Mahādeva while situating his worship within the sacred geography of Vārāṇasī (Kāśī)
  and its ritual systems—particularly the worship of the liṅga, ritual ablution with
  Ganges water, and the recitation of Vedic mantras. The poem represents a synthesis
  of Vedantic philosophy and Śaiva tantra meditated through vernacular Telugu verse.
