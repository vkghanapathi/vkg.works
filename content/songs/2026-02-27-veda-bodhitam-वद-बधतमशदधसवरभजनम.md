abstract: A devotional bhajana (song of worship) in the Śuddhā Sāverī rāga that exhorts
  the practitioner toward dharma, truthful speech, and virtue as taught by the Vedas.
  The work combines Sanskrit liturgical elements with structured musical form (pallavi
  and caraṇam), embedding ethical instruction within a melodic framework suited to
  congregational or temple performance.
preamble: This composition belongs to the South Indian bhajana tradition, a devotional
  song genre that synthesizes Vedic philosophy with classical rāga music. The pallavi
  emphasizes dharma (righteousness) and satya (truth) as foundational Vedic values,
  while the reference to the Yajur Veda's mahāyāga (great ritual) and paramēśvara
  (the supreme deity) grounds the work in Vedic ritual and theistic practice. Such
  compositions typically function as vehicles for both spiritual instruction and musical
  cultivation, performed in temples, homes, and learning contexts throughout Karnataka
  and South India.
