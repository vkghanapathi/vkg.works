abstract: Veda Puruṣam Saṅkhyāma is a devotional enumeration poem that systematizes
  Vedic knowledge through numerical categorization and sacred correspondences. The
  work traces the structure of Vedic learning—from the foundational syllable Oṃ through
  the Vedas, Vedāṅgas, ritual fires, cardinal directions, bodily channels, and divine
  presiding deities—culminating in the philosophical affirmation that Brahman is the
  substratum of all knowledge and existence. This composition exemplifies the traditional
  Hindu synthesis of scriptural learning (śruti), ritual science, and non-dual philosophy.
preamble: This work belongs to the Vedāntic devotional poetry tradition within Hinduism,
  specifically addressing the systematic study of Vedic knowledge (Vedic learning
  and its auxiliary disciplines). It draws on the Upaniṣadic framework of understanding
  Brahman as sat-cit-ānanda (being-consciousness-bliss), while incorporating the fourfold
  Vedic corpus, the six Vedāṅgas (auxiliary disciplines), the five ritual fires central
  to Vedic sacrifice, the eight cardinal directions with their presiding deities,
  and the nine bodily apertures as microcosmic correlates of cosmic principles. The
  invocation of the ten directional guardians (dikpālas) and the enumeration of Vedic
  knowledge reflect the comprehensive cosmological vision characteristic of Sanskrit
  classical learning.
