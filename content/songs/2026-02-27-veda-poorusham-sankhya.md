abstract: 'A devotional enumeration of the Vedic cosmos and its sacred components,
  presented as a series of numbered stanzas (1–11) that systematically catalogue foundational
  Vedic elements: the primacy of Oṃ, the dual structure of Vedic knowledge (mantra
  and brāhmaṇa), the vyāhr̥tis, the four Vedas, the five sacred fires, the six Vedāṅgas,
  the eight cardinal directions and their presiding deities, the nine vital breaths
  (prāṇa), the ten directional guardians (dikpāla), and culminating in a meditation
  on Sāṃkhya philosophy and the non-dual reality of sat-cit-ānanda. The work functions
  as both a ritual mnemonics and a metaphysical summary of Vedic cosmology.'
preamble: This composition belongs to the Telugu Vedic devotional tradition and engages
  with core Vedic and Upaniṣadic metaphysics through an enumerated, pedagogical structure.
  Its systematic treatment of Vedic divisions (the four Vedas, their ancillary disciplines
  or Vedāṅgas, and ritual implements) reflects the orthodox Hindu intellectual framework
  for Vedic learning. The work moves progressively from external liturgical elements
  (the fires of the Vedic altar) through cosmic geography (the eight directions and
  their deities) to the anatomy of subtle embodied consciousness (the nine vital channels),
  before resolving into metaphysical non-duality. This reflects the characteristic
  Hindu progression from ritual to cosmos to self-realization.
