abstract: A devotional song in Telugu composed in the classical format of pallavi
  and charanam, celebrating the guru as the embodiment of Vedic wisdom and spiritual
  guidance. The work synthesizes Vedic learning (veda-vidyā), ritual injunction (veda-karma),
  and the path to liberation (mokṣa) through the mediation of the preceptor, presenting
  the guru as both the revealer of scriptural truth and the liberator from saṃsāra.
preamble: This composition belongs to the tradition of guru-worship within Vedantic
  and Tantric Hindu practice, wherein the spiritual preceptor is honored as the manifest
  form of the divine and the gateway to self-realization. The work invokes Gaṇapati
  (Ganesh) alongside the veneration of the guru-deity, establishing a theological
  framework in which Vedic knowledge (transmitted through the guru), ritual action
  (karma), and philosophical inquiry (jñāna) converge as means to transcendence. Set
  within the Telugu literary and devotional context, the song articulates the classical
  Indian metaphysical concern with release from the cycle of rebirth through the guru's
  instruction and grace.
