abstract: A devotional hymn in Telugu celebrating Śrī Veṅkaṭa Datta, an incarnation
  of Datta Guru installed at the Datta Pīṭham in Tirupati. Structured as a series
  of metrically organized stanzas with Sanskrit-Telugu hybrid diction, the song employs
  Vedic allusions and philosophical epithets to invoke the deity's grace while providing
  detailed doctrinal commentary on divine attributes such as the destruction of desire,
  purification of sins, and manifestation of eternal consciousness.
preamble: This work belongs to the Telugu bhakti tradition centered on Śrī Veṅkaṭeśvara
  and the Datta sampradāya (lineage), a significant branch of Advaita-influenced devotionalism
  in South India. The Datta Pīṭham at Tirupati represents the institutional anchor
  of this tradition, and the present hymn functions as both liturgical praise and
  philosophical instruction for practitioners seeking knowledge (jñāna) and liberation
  through surrender to the guru-form of the deity. The work synthesizes Vedic authority
  with vernacular accessibility, a hallmark of medieval and early modern South Indian
  religious composition.
