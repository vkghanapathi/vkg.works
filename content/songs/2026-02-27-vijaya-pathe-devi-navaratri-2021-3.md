abstract: A devotional song from Dr. Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī's Navaratri collection
  invoking Devi Durga as the supreme source of auspiciousness (maṅgalyam) and prosperity.
  The composition celebrates the goddess's role in securing household welfare, conjugal
  felicity, virtuous progeny, and freedom from poverty for her devoted worshippers,
  with accompanying theological commentary (bhāvārtha) in Telugu.
preamble: This work belongs to the Navaratri liturgical tradition, which celebrates
  the nine-night festival honoring Devi (the Divine Feminine) in her various forms
  across Hindu devotional practice. The song specifically addresses Devi Durga, the
  victorious warrior goddess, within a framework emphasizing her function as guarantor
  of worldly and spiritual prosperity (maṅgalyam). The composition reflects a broader
  Telugu devotional literature tradition wherein ritual invocations are paired with
  vernacular theological exposition, making sacred concepts accessible to vernacular
  speakers while maintaining Sanskrit textual authority.
