abstract: A devotional song sequence composed in Telugu celebrating the victory and
  supremacy of the Guru (spiritual preceptor), specifically honouring Gaṇapati Saccidānanda
  Svāmin and his lineage of disciples (Svāmījī and Appājī). The four verses invoke
  blessings of longevity, prosperity, and spiritual wisdom upon the Guru and all devotees,
  employing classical Sanskrit poetic conventions and Vedic liturgical language to
  reinforce the Guru's role as a dispenser of knowledge and spiritual liberation.
preamble: 'This work belongs to the tradition of Guru-centric devotional composition
  within Hindu and Vedantic practice, where the spiritual preceptor is venerated as
  an embodiment of ultimate reality (Saccidānanda: Being-Consciousness-Bliss). The
  verses follow the conventions of Sanskrit liturgical hymns (stotras) adapted into
  Telugu vernacular poetry, invoking the Guru''s grace to purify devotees'' understanding
  and establish them in non-dual wisdom (advaita). Such compositions are typically
  recited or sung in spiritual communities dedicated to Vedantic instruction and monastic
  lineages.'
