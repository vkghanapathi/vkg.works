abstract: A devotional song (kīrtana) composed in Telugu celebrating Vijayavāṭī Kanakadurgā
  as the supreme mother goddess, invoking her protection and blessing. The composition
  follows classical kīrtana structure with pallavi, anupallavi, and four charaṇas,
  weaving together references to the Nine Forms of Durgā (navavidhā durgāmbikā) and
  their associated qualities and cosmic functions.
preamble: This work belongs to the devotional music tradition of South Indian Hindu
  worship, specifically the Durgā Saptaśatī liturgical cycle centred on the goddess
  Durgā and her nine forms (Śailaputrī, Brahmacharya, Chandraghantā, Kūṣmāndā, Skandamātā,
  Kātyāyanī, Kālarātri, Mahāgaurī, and Siddhidātrī). The kīrtana form—a lyrical devotional
  composition—was developed extensively in Telugu and Kannada temple traditions as
  a means of ritual worship and spiritual instruction. References to the goddess's
  names, colours (agnivarṇā, golden), and cosmic attributes situate this composition
  within the Śākta theological framework honouring the divine feminine as mātr̥mūrti
  (mother form) and the source of victory (jaya) and auspiciousness (lakṣmī).
