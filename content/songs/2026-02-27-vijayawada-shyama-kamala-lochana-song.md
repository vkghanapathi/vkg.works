abstract: This work is a collection of devotional songs composed in Telugu by Dr.
  Vamshi Krishna Ghanapāṭhī. The songs represent a modern scholarly engagement with
  classical Indian musical and poetic traditions, blending traditional metrics and
  thematic concerns with contemporary compositional practice.
preamble: Telugu devotional song composition (bhakti padya) has a rich tradition spanning
  from the medieval Bhakti movement through classical courtly courts to modern scholarship.
  This collection situates itself within that continuity, drawing on the conventions
  of kīrtana, padya, and other forms of sacred and secular lyric poetry. The songs
  reflect Dr. Ghanapāṭhī's dual expertise in Vedic recitation traditions (ghanapāṭha)
  and classical Telugu literature, making this work a bridge between ritual Vedic
  practice and literary composition.
