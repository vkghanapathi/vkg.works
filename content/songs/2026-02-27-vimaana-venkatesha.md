abstract: A devotional song in classical Telugu kīrtana form composed in honour of
  Vēṅkaṭēśvara at Tirupati, celebrating his transcendent glory equated with the celestial
  vimāna (temple tower). The work employs the three-part structure of pallavi, anupallavi,
  and charaṇam to invoke the deity's grace and the spiritual benefits accrued to his
  devotees through vision of his sacred sanctuary.
preamble: This composition belongs to the bhakti musical tradition of South Indian
  temple worship, specifically the kīrtana genre performed in Vaiṣṇava temples of
  the Tirupati shrine. Vēṅkaṭēśvara, a manifestation of Viṣṇu enshrined on the Tirupati
  hills, is one of Hinduism's most widely worshipped deities. The vimāna—the ornate
  pyramidal tower crowning the inner sanctum—symbolises both the architectural grandeur
  of the temple and the cosmic axis connecting earth and heaven. Devotional compositions
  celebrating the vimāna form an established subgenre within South Indian temple music,
  emphasizing the sanctity of darśana (sacred vision) and the liberation attainable
  through devotion.
