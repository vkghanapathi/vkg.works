abstract: A devotional song sequence (pallavi, anupallavi, charanam structure) composed
  in Telugu honouring Viśvarūpa Datta, a revered spiritual figure associated with
  multiple sacred sites and pilgrimage centres across South India. The work combines
  liturgical praise with references to specific geographical and ritual locations,
  functioning as both a devotional invocation and a cartography of sacred places connected
  to the deity's manifestations and blessings.
preamble: This composition belongs to the tradition of Telugu devotional music (bhakti
  kīrtanam), specifically the formal song structure inherited from South Indian classical
  and semi-classical musical practices. It honours Viśvarūpa Datta within a Hindu
  philosophical framework emphasizing the Sat-Chit-Ānanda (Being-Consciousness-Bliss)
  principle. The work references multiple pilgrimage centres—including Gañgāpura,
  the Bhīmā and Amara rivers, and locations associated with Narasimha—situating devotion
  within the lived geography of South Indian sacred sites. Composed in February 2011,
  this represents a modern composition in a centuries-old liturgical genre.
